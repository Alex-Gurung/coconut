He absently flipped through the case file of Uma, somehow the atmosphere matching the mournful story he was reading.\n\nAccording to the notes, Uma was a trainer and part-time script consultant at the same fitness center where Irving, the suspect, also trained. Both typically scheduled their workouts late in the evening, customarily ending when the gym was mostly vacant. The evening Uma met her untimely demise, irrefutable evidence shows Irving stayed later than she did, apparently relishing the solitude. The stark lighting of the closed gym only added to the chilly atmosphere.\n\nWinston carefully sipped his coffee, the bitter taste pulling him from his reverie. Grabbing his notepad, he jotted down a few points to discuss with Irving. Apart from his regular gym routine, various aspects of his writing career were catching Winston's eye.\n\nIrving was known for his precise work on scripts, specifically for his detailed research into harmful substances, even down to their handling and utilization. His alarmingly realistic work had earned him a strange kind of reputation, though no one could deny it fascinated viewers.\n\nGiven this, Uma’s claim that Irving stole her work didn’t seem so far off. Looking closely at her file again, Winston found a direct threat from Uma stating she would expose Irving's deception to the public. It seemed like this plagiarism accusation had Irving on edge, a tension that seemed to whisper of something dangerous. \n\nHeading out of the diner, Winston decided to head over to Irving’s apartment. It was a short drive, the buildings looming against the gloomy sky forebodingly, each window alight as though the eyes of some unseen spectators.\n\nAs he approached the building, he recalled a report of Irving carrying a vial from his car to his apartment. The vial itself seemed ordinary but combined with his previous online purchases of corrosive substances from a store, it painted a grim picture.\n\nUpon reaching the apartment, his observational skills kicked in, the detective noting the absence of lights; Irving had not yet returned home. His mind wandered back to the fitness center, and the reports claiming that Irving usually stayed late rang even truer considering the current time.\n\n\"Hey, Winston,\" barked a voice over the phone, pulling him back to reality. \n\n\"Irving went home, got caught in the morning traffic. You guess what he drove?\"\n\nWinston sighed, the picture painfully clear. \"I'm guessing it was a car.\"\n\n\"Well, today's just full of surprises for you, innit? Yeah, it was the car,\" the officer on the other line chuckled before he hung up.\n\nWinston leaned against the chilling wall, thoughts whirling around in his mind, the proverbially web becoming denser with each passing moment. Irving had a lot to answer for, and that included what happened the tragic night Uma was murdered.\n\nWinston squinted at the digital clock on his car's dashboard; it was 7 p.m., Uma's workout time, the hour at which the tragedy had unfolded. Winston seemed to have developed a knack for piecing together the minutiae of his victim's lives, to the point he often found himself involved in their routines. Not too far from Uma's favourite treadmills, he could see Addison, Uma's personal trainer, putting another client through his paces. \n\n\"I heard about Uma.\" The trace of guilt was ever so subtle in Addison's voice. \n\n\"I suppose you were her trainer?\" Winston asked, casually observing the gym. \n\n\"Yes, Uma had a steady workout routine. Four times a week, without fail.\" Addison seemed to be avoiding his gaze, focusing on tidying up some equipment round. \"It was during my work hours and we had a well-set regimen. It never changed. Not even on the day she was killed.\"\n\nAs Winston took note of the gym's patrons and its facilities, he noticed the safe was situated in such a way that it was visible to the entire room. There was a sign that read, 'No unauthorized access.' Winston, however, recalled something from the case file about Addison being seen taking money from the said safe.\n\nArriving back at his office, Winston rifled through his jacket pocket for his notes. As he scanned the document for his key points he remembered Addison had recently caught the gym's attention... and not for his training talent. Apparently, money had begun to disappear from the gym's safe after Addison started working there, around the same time Uma found out about some theft.\n\nLooking over the notes, Winston couldn't ignore the fact that none of Addison's training sessions took him to distant locations. They were all locally based, suggesting that the man had absolutely no need to travel out of town. However, according to the evidence, Addison purchased several items out of the locality, paying in cash to avoid the money being traced. Winston wondered if it was from the same cash that was disappearing from the gym's safe?\n\nIt was getting late, and the detective had had his fill of theories for one day. He decided it was time for some shut-eye, hoping that a good night's rest would help him unravel the mystery he found himself steeped in.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

He watched as Gregory, the auctioneer, went about his usual business. This case didn't seem too out of the ordinary at first, another murder with plenty of unanswered questions. But Gregory was in the sights.\n\nHe had been observing Gregory for some time now and knew that he frequented the local jazz club just down the street after auction nights. In fact, on the night of the murder, Gregory had been seen leaving the auction and going straight to the club. Winston glanced down the street at the club's flickering neon sign which was a painful reminder of where Abigail had taken her last breath.\n\nHe stepped out of the car, barely pausing to trace the path Gregory would have walked that night, before entering the auction house. Throughout their conversation, Gregory seemed more pressured than typical auctioneers. Winston got the impression that Gregory was worried about something… He had learned through his observations that Gregory often stayed behind after auctions to go over the inventory. As the lead auctioneer, he had unrestricted access to the dagger collection, even after hours.\n\nAbigail had arranged a meeting with the regulatory authority, something that would have undoubtedly placed Gregory in hot water. If the regulatory body were to uncover the irregularities in his work, he'd face immediate dismissal. For Gregory, it was more than just a job he was about to lose; it was his entire life.\n\nAs they talked, Gregory showed Winston an auction that had happened on the night of the murder. A myriad of items were on display. Among them was a dagger that sat ominously in the glass showcase. It was undeniably similar to the one that was used to murder Abigail.\n\nWinston left the auction house with plenty to think about. He knew Abigail was onto Gregory. She had unearthed evidence linking him to fraudulent auctions in the past. But Gregory was a regular at the jazz club - it was part of his routine after a long day immersed in the busy and intense world of auctions. Winston walked away from the auction house, a stone's throw from the jazz club, ready to dive deeper into the case.\n\nWinston, the seasoned detective, walked into the jazz club where Abigail was found dead, her body marked by a wound that could've only been made by a dagger. The atmosphere of the place was still heavy with shock and sorrow. He took a walk around the club, scanning for anything that might offer valuable information.\n\nAs he waited for the club owner to gather the employees for him to interview, he scrolled through his phone, reading an article about Madelyn, a lawyer who specialized in high-conflict legal cases. It was said that due to her involvement in these cases, she had been the recipient of several threats from unknown people looking to intimidate her. \n\nHe spotted her in a few photos attending court late into the night, a stapled fact rising from the tarmac of her professional biography. The detective glanced at his wrist-watch, from her office to here it would have been less than a 10-minute ride; a fact that caught him off guard.\n\nMadelyn worked hard as a defense lawyer on a high-profile criminal case. Because of the nature of her work, she had been targeted in deleterious ways recently, including having her credit card information stolen. She was often at the office until late and regularly visited other parts of the city after dark for work.\n\nThe detective sifted through more news about her facing some financial peril: Madelyn’s credit card information theft was believed to be done to sabotage her work as a lawyer. On top of that, a major lawsuit was looming over her; the lawsuit Abigail was about to slam on her, which could result in financial ruin for the lawyer.\n\nHe came across another exciting piece of information. As a history enthusiast, Madelyn had an interesting hobby – she collected antique daggers, an interest that mirrored the punctured wound on Abigail and piqued Winston's curiosity.\n\nConnecting the dots, Madelyn wasn't just a common lawyer. The threats from unknown sources that tied to her high-conflict cases, her recent credit card theft, and the pending litigation from Abigail turned the situation into more than just a professional dilemma.\n\nAs the jazz club employees started filing into the room, Winston sat down in a corner, still staring at the screen of his phone, fixated on Madelyn, a top professional in her field, pressurized by unknown threats and a lawsuit that could spell financial doom. While the facts were bone-chilling, the detective knew this information was indispensable in his quest for truth.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Gregory\nB.

He had a job to do, clients to talk to, and informants to hear out, but his focus tonight wasn't on the cooperative adults and chatty patrons, it was on Van, the event’s planner.\n\nVan has a reputation. Not only is he known for organizing these fancy soirees but also for ruthlessly pushing aside any competition. Van had an audacious knack of winning over some of Frederick's most valued clients, hence usurping his business. This was on top of threats aimed at Frederick, who was also an event organizer and who had recently acquired numerous contracts in the territory. Frederick's sudden upturn in business didn't exactly resonate well with Van, who allegedly had gone as far as threatening him to step down.\n\n\"Van...\", Winston spoke out the minute he caught Van alone and away from his guests. \"What's the hurry?', Van said with a laugh. But Winston had noticed Van leaving the gala earlier that evening, slipping out shortly before the tragic event had happened.\n\n\"I hear Frederick was quite a tough competitor, huh?\" Van sarcastically laughed it off, \"Competition is the spice of life, isn't it? Well, he had a thing for these tastings, and he managed to gain some of my clients. But, as they gradually realize his events lack the flair mine have, they’re coming back to me.\"\n\nWinston moved forward with his inquiry, \"What were you doing with this corkscrew?\", pointing towards the table where Van was earlier seen opening wine bottles for thirsty socialites. Van shrugged. \"I was merely pairing some fantastic wines for our attendees.\"\n\nWinston kept his questions short, not to spook the suspect but enough to get a rough sense of his motives, \"Taking this road home?\", he hinted towards the road leading towards Frederick’s motel, conveniently a 5-minute drive from the venue. Van nodded. \"Yeah, it's the quickest route home\" he muttered.\n\nWith these statements, Winston departed from the event venue. A sigh escaped him as he made his way back to his car. The wheels in his mind turning constantly, going over the evening's events and the information gathered about Van. Van’s explanation of leaving the event early presented no other commitments, his constant threats to Frederick over contracts, and the fact that an autopsy had already confirmed that the puncture wounds on Frederick's body were indeed from a corkscrew; all this weighed heavy on Winston's heart. But he had to keep digging with potential leads yet to be explored. Despite the evening’s high society wine event, it was turning out to be a sobering beginning to their investigation into Frederick’s unexpected and gruesome demise.\n\nWinston studied the paperwork laid out on his desk. It was puzzling- Frederick, an affluent man, ended up murdered in a motel with a corkscrew. The reports he had read clearly stated that Frederick was well aware of Tessa’s burdening financial circumstances, given that she often approached him for loans. His next interview was with Tessa, a waitress at an upscale restaurant known for its wine selection. From feedback he got from Tessa's coworker at the restaurant, she was often seen working late at the office, seemingly entering data that matched known individuals. He made a note of the odd details, like the fact that Tessa always carries a corkscrew for her job.\n\nUpon arrival at the restaurant, Winston noticed Tessa. As he approached her, he saw her with a corkscrew in hand, opening a bottle of wine with practiced ease. \"Hello, Tessa, do you have a moment?\" Her fingers never stopped their diligent dance around the wine bottle.\n\nShe glanced up, unbothered by his interruption, \"What can I do for you, Detective?\"\n\n\"Just have some questions, I won't take much of your time,\" Winston said as he observed her deftness with the corkscrew.\n\nAs the talk proceeded, Frederick's friend divulged that it was not uncommon to see Tessa asking Frederick for loans. Tessa's reaction to this information was similar to her response when Frederick mentioned his intention to expose her secret. The anxiety painted on her face was enough to prompt Winston to dig deeper.\n\nAfter wrapping up at the restaurant, he headed to her apartment. Noticing the illuminated screen of Tessa's computer, he quietly waited. The screen displayed a private investigator's database, hinting at her unusual extracurricular activities.\n\n\"Working late from home again, Tessa?\" Winston probed as he made his way into her field of vision.\n\n\"Just going over some... Financial issues, Detective,\" she replied, her eyes darting away.\n\n\"Like loans?\" Winston questioned further, recalling the pieces of information about her financial struggles and Frederick's awareness of her debt.\n\nOnce startled by the thought of being the suspect under arrest, Tessa reached automatically for something in her pocket, pulling out her own corkscrew. This time it seemed much more akin to a defensive tool than anything work-related. Winston motioned for the officers behind him, leading to Tessa's immediate arrest.\n\n\"Loans, yes,\" she finally confessed, her discomfort clear as handcuffs cinched around her wrists, her own corkscrew now a piece of evidence.\n\nAs Winston left, his mind buzzed with the new information. Tessa’s financial troubles, her striking familiarity with a corkscrew, and her late-night data entry pointed towards the upcoming climax of the investigation... which was far from clear just yet.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

He remembered how Tommy had been using it as a means of blackmail against Lucy - greedy beast he was. Tommy had demanded a large sum to hush about Lucy's secret. A sum that Lucy, an aspiring dancer barely affording her paint-filled pastime, couldn't possibly conjure.\n\nHis thoughts snapped to their conversation earlier. Lucy, agitated, standing in the doorway of her paint splattered studio, her hands dripping with her much-loved shade of red from the recent session of painting. Something about the way she plunged her hands into the sink, washing away the red stains seemed unnerving.\n\nLucy was visibly shaken at Tommy's demands. She was cornered with no other way out. The mere thought of her secret getting exposed was enough to bring an end to her fledgling dancing career. There was guilt in her eyes as she admitted about the strange turn of events where she mistakenly sent that anonymous letter to Tommy revealing her own secret.\n\nJust as he shook himself out of his thoughts, the image of Lucy dancing with a shiv flashed in his mind. Her movements were enchanting and the shiv she used was not merely a prop, but an essential part of her performance. The paradox of the individual both skilled with the art of dance and a deadly weapon was a perplexing sight.\n\nThe strange assortment of her paintings didn’t go unnoticed either. Winston remembered walking past her easel with an unfinished painting of dismembered body parts, oddly shaded with her favored tone of red. Lucy had confessed that each painting was born from her deep-seated emotions.\n\nLeaving her studio, Winston got into his cruiser with his mind reeling from the unfathomable strands of evidence, reflecting what a strange web of circumstances he found himself entangled in.\n\nWinston considered the crime scene: a fitness center. An unlikely place for Tommy to meet his end - on a treadmill no less. Tommy was certainly physically fit, and recently had become quite popular among locals due to his polarizing political views. He was often the subject of public discourse, none more vocal than Jacqueline in her opposition to his ideas.\n\nThe forensic team gave him the breakdown, a shiv. Winston could only sigh at the gruesomeness of it all. NHS workers giving it their best shot trying to return the room to its former glory. However, whoever was responsible was not the type to make petty mistakes.\n\nJacqueline was next on his visit list. A regular protester at Tommy's rallies, her public denouncements of his political stances were well known. And since the murder had occurred during her workout, it would make sense to hear from her.\n\nJacqueline - a nicely aged woman, apparently physically fit and capable – was a regular at the gym. She trained there every day without fail. That day she was pulling off a routine on a rowing machine with a synchronicity one could compare to a clock tick. \n\n\"Do you remember seeing or hearing anything unusual?\" Winston asked.\n\nJacqueline halted her rowing, turning to Winston with a crisp look in her eyes. \"No, detective,\" she said, dabbing a sweat towel on her forehead. \"In fact, it was ironically business as usual.\"\n\nBusiness as usual. In a way, Winston thought, it was. Tommy was known for riling up others, though nothing harmful ever really seemed to come of it. Until now. \n\nThe talk around town was that Jacqueline had served time for 15 years nearly two decades ago. Interestingly, she'd also studied various forms of self-defense while in prison, and since her release, she had made herself a bastion of physical and mental fortitude.\n\n\"People don't change, detective,\" Jacqueline stated, seemingly reading his mind. \"When I was younger I made some bad choices. I've paid for them. We all have a past and mine happens to be a bit darker than others.\"\n\n\"And Tommy,\" Jacqueline paused, searching Winston's face, \"He was just like me, just on the other side of the fence. Got too comfortable and careless, people like Tommy have a way of doing that.\"\n\n\"All I can say is lots of people contribute to anti-Tommy campaigns, and I have my own ideas. It's free speech, right?\" With unwavering determination, Jacqueline continued her pointed assertions against Tommy, echoing her public remarks. She went back to her rowing routine without missing a beat, her eyes now fixed on the TV that was flashing Tommy's controversial speeches on a news channel.\n\nWinston thought for a moment before making his exit. He came across Jacqueline plenty of times, she was a regular - like an everyday murmur with a well-timed routine. Winston left with more questions than answers.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Lucy\nB.

No doubt Fred, the diligent night shift security guard for Dance Studio Giselle had devoted her life to, would again bring up the unsolved murder case. It was a habit of Fred to discuss the crime, be it casually or at a formal setting like the staff meetings.\n\nWinston remembered Giselle mentioning Fred's constant references to the crime whenever they had personal interactions. Giselle's murder, occurring during a late-night practice at her dance studio when Fred was on his night shift, had flipped their world upside down, and now there was a whole list of strange occurrences. Fred had been caught, multiple times, brooding over his notebook scribbling details about the various events. Not just during his nightly shifts, but meticulously recording the date, time, and details of each recent crime that took place in and around the dance studio.\n\nWinston often wondered about the contents of Fred's notebook. He recalled Fred having overheard a personal conversation between Giselle and himself when she had openly voiced her plans to bring her findings about his security lapses to the authorities. It was strange how quickly Fred had been informed about it, almost as if he had intentionally been listening in.\n\nSlowly sipping his coffee, Winston made his way to Fred’s space, hearing the familiar scratch of Fred’s pen against paper. Fred, tall with broad shoulders and a hard-set face, looked up, his pen momentarily idle.\n\nFred, never one to skip over details, asked, as if on cue, \"Detective, any updates about the murder?\"\n\n\"Fred,\" Winston carefully started, acknowledging his inquiry. \"Yes, updates about Giselle's claim of finding evidence against your nighttime security practices and her plan of taking it to the authorities. You knew about it, didn't you?\"\n\nFred chuckled nervously and looked down at his notebook, his eyes lingering on his detailed crime records. Nodding, he softly confessed, \"Yes, I overheard her talking about it. Couldn't help but worry, detective.\"\n\nIntent on keeping a keen eye on each detail, detective Winston left Fred back to recounting the happenings in his notebook, knowing there were a lot more facts to align in this perplexing puzzle.\n\nWinston assembled his notes and drained his mug of lukewarm coffee. He turned his thoughts to Giselle, the victim. From all accounts she was a wealthy ballerina, well-loved in the community, rarely seen without a crowd applauding her every move. She had no children, but was known to be frugal, having long been building a nest egg for an ambitious future. He grimaced. The future was one thing she no longer had.\n\nHis next stop was at a bustling hospital. His entrance was marked by the characteristic smell of disinfectant and the chaos of emergency medical staff rushing about. Among them, he used to find Imogen, a former nurse who likely felt comfortable amidst the syringes, gloves and pill bottles. Imogen had worked there long enough to cultivate a reliable reputation, until her recent dismissal. Winston had been notified about her job loss by a hospital insider.\n\nAfter the hospital, detective Winston drove to Imogen's house. Imogen was Giselle’s godmother, and they shared a close bond, so close that Giselle confided in her like no other. Imogen was among the few who knew about Giselle’s financial prudence as she saved for the future. Giselle treated Imogen like a member of her own family, even extending an implicit trust to her. She invited Imogen to her performances and elite parties frequently, detective Winston noted a stack of fancy invitations on Imogen's side table. \n\nWith the pleasantries out of the way, the detective carefully broached the subject of Imogen’s financial struggles. He had discovered that Imogen had some rather sizable medical bills to pay. These bills burdened her with a severe debt. This was no small sum to be owing, especially after losing her job.\n\n“You asked for financial help from Giselle, didn't you?” he asked, choosing his words carefully. Imogen looked away, nodding and admitting,\"Yes, losing my job was a shock. I asked her for help.\"\n\nWinston could tell this wasn’t an easy admission for Imogen, her goddaughter’s death compounded by the guilt of asking for financial help. As their conversation came to an end, Winston thanked her for cooperation and walked back to his car. \n\nNo conclusions had been drawn. No suspects had been named, but the information gathered from Imogen was another piece in a complex puzzle. The very picture of a detective's work. A bottomless mug of coffee, a relentless quest for answers... and a lingering smell of hospital disinfectant.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Fred\nB.

It was a bear trap, photoed very professionally, apparently a purchase option from a hunting gear store. The same kind of bear trap that Alex, the store's owner, had previously confirmed was in his inventory. The kind that was used to kill Troy, the political figure who was stirring up legislation that might directly harm Alex's business. The same Troy with whom Alex had several disagreements over their contradicting business policies.\n\nOfficer Gordon stuck his head through the door frame of Winston's office and said, \"That's our guy, Alex. Well, not ours just yet, not officially. He owns that hunting store and certainly stocks up on various gears including bear traps. Bear traps that have a little too much in common with the one that killed Troy. Furthermore, Alex not only seeks profit from the sales but also frequently talks about wanting to get payments from the store.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Winston responded, his voice as gruff as ever. Hunting gears and jockeys, a rather unusual combination.\n\n\"Alex was seen there, right on the mall security cameras,\" Gordon continued, flipping through his notebook, \"At the mall, I mean, on the tragic day that Troy was murdered in the same mall. He's there every day, apparently. Always, seeking to extract whatever profits he can, for he's constantly paying out more than he's earning.\"\n\nWinston considered Alex's unpaid bills, the taxes that he feared due to Troy's legislation. \"Intense on protecting his business, this Alex, huh?\"\n\n\"Like a bantam rooster,\"  Gordon replied, allowing a brief smirk. \"Aggressive, seemingly always under fire from Troy's politics—affecting his particular industry. The guy is desperate, seeking any revenue he can squeeze from his daily store visits.\" \n\n\"Where is he now, Gordon?\" \n\n\"In his store, most likely, clinging onto any profits he can manage. It's just about the only stability he has given his current financial standing.\"\n\nWinston hoisted himself up, grasped the photograph of the bear trap in one hand, his coffee in the other, and left the office, off to talk to this Alex character who, if appearances suggested so much, was living life on the edge of bankruptcy because of Troy. But, only time would tell if this Alex has more to his story than just an affinity for hunting gears, desperate need for store payments, and a few significant debts.\n\nStanding in the cavernous, bustling landscapes of the city shopping mall, Winston took in the lurid pastel shades, the shoppers with their arms filled with bags, and the little kids scampering about. Confirmation from security footage had ensured him that Troy had been seen here on the day of the murder, the same way he'd bring himself anywhere else he went - frequently and with money in mind.\n\nAs Winston walked, he passed the small kiosk heralding ads from local businesses. A particular one popped out - Clyde's Auto Shop, conveniently situated just a stone's throw away from the mall. A frown creased Winston's brow. The same Clyde that was in his little black notebook, the same Clyde who had close business interactions with Troy. But that was a matter for a different time.\n\nInside his little black notebook, Winston had noted that Clyde had previously loaned Troy, a regular customer, money for repairs on his car. Winston also knew that Troy was unable to pay Clyde back at the moment, forcing Clyde to struggle financially. These were all connections worth considering.\n\nAt the crime scene, a half-removed bear trap looked horrendously out of place amidst the clean tiled floors and tastefully constructed backgrounds that made up the mall's scenery. Whoever had the audacity to bring that thing here...\n\nAfter calling it a day with the crime scene, he headed over to confront Clyde. The shop was a wrenching sight. Machines of various shapes and sizes lay strewn about, all producing a clanking noise that threatened to give Winston a headache. Clyde was evidently absent from his place behind the counter, but his workers pointed him out in the mall, where they claimed he was buying new equipment for his struggling auto shop.\n\nFinding Clyde in a store struck Winston as unusual. \"Clyde,\" Winston called out, making the man jump.\n\n\"Well, Howdy there,\" Clyde grunted back, evidently not in the best of moods.\n\n\"Heard about Troy?\" Winston asked, watching Clyde's reaction closely.\n\n\"Bloke still owes me money for his car repairs,\" Clyde confessed, \"Struggling as it was, I even gave him loans. He was unable to pay me back.\"\n\nWinston definitely noticed the familiarity Clyde spoke of Troy with. There was something brewing, he could sense it.\n\n“Work, yeah,” Clyde huffed, “Sure seems there’s always something urgent at the prison.”\n\nAh, the prison. Winston distinctly remembered Clyde's rather infamous stint at the local prison, where he worked as a corrections officer. Apparently, Clyde was infamously frequently absent during his tenure. And that one particular absence... It coincided with a notorious inmate's escape, who was serving his sentence for a brutal crime. Clyde had claimed he was on duties, doing his rounds, and just did not notice the escape. This was something difficult to swallow, suspicious even.\n\nClyde had left that job later, after facing several complaints about his behaviour. Winston made a note of everything, knowing that they may lead to something substantial later on.\n\nAs he left the shopping mall, Winston found his sight drawn to the auto shop again. It was billowing out a cloud of dark smoke. He squinted, but his gaze was yanked back to the mall, to the pastel hues, and unbearable anticipation. The murderer was still out here somewhere, Winston vowed to find him. After all, they were all characters in this play, but he was the conductor. And it was time he directed them towards the end.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Alex\nB.

This was the last place Abigail had been alive, an exciting and lively jazz club just around the block from the auction house. Gregory often found solace in the live music after a long day of auctioneering.\n\nThis was not exactly how Winston had pictured an auctioneer — the eccentric hairstyles and the ever-changing eye color almost seemed out of place. It was a trendy hair salon, where Gregory was seen frequently, the very place where he picked up the hottest hairstyle every week.\n\nAs the auction closed, Gregory was seen stepping out from the auction house appearing somewhat relieved. Revenge in the air as Abigail had been on the edge of revealing a secret that would cripple Gregory's career as an auctioneer forever. The quiet murmurs of the patrons in the auction hall only escalating the tension.\n\nWinston ventured towards the auction house the following day. As the day turned into evening, Gregory arrived carrying a small bag. He was approached by the security guard who nodded in recognition, allowing the auctioneer inside with no questions asked. So, Gregory indeed had access to the auction house and its collections after hours.\n\nWinston found himself hovering around the dagger collection. One in particular caught his eye, it was remarkably similar to the one used to murder Abigail. Gregory had auctioned a similar one on the night of the murder. \n\nHe contemplated this later walking down the street, passing a storefront when something caught his eye. It was a small shop selling colored contacts. Looking at the CCTV footage, Winston recognized Gregory purchasing some colored contacts at the store. And just like his trendy hairstyles, Gregory's eye color seemed to change every few days. \n\nAs the evening deepened, Gregory was seen leaving the auction house and stepping into the jazz club. The same sequence of events that had taken place on the night of Abigail's murder. \n\n\"Mister Gregory, can I have a word with you?\" Winston approached the auctioneer later that night, finding him in the dimly lit jazz club. Gregory accepted with a nod.\n\n\"So, you're a frequenter, I heard?\" Winston made lighthearted conversation.\n\n\"Only after each auction, detective.\" Gregory answered coolly. No signs of guilt, only a man enjoying his evening with his familiar jazz music.\n\n\"Must be nice, being an auctioneer, seeing all sorts of precious things come and go.\"\n\nGregory chuckled, \"Quite so, detective. Keeps the job exciting.\"\n\n\"And the jazz club, just around the corner. Convenient, isn't it?”\n\n“Indeed,” Gregory concluded cryptically. Winston left him at that, gathering his coat and calling it a night. There was some catching up to do and a murderer to catch.\n\nWinston turned the crime scene photos over and over in his mind. The jazz club was bustling, alive with music, laughter, and the chatter of living souls. Between the shadowy saxophone player and the wisps of smoky haze, the rolling melodies echoed cries for the one lost – Abigail.\n\nWinston sighed and rose from his chair, reaching for his coat. In one corner of the crime scene picture, a glimmering dagger caught his eye, a seemingly misplaced relic amidst the modern jazz club surroundings. With an imminent late-night visit to the scene, he prepared for his encounter with Madelyn.\n\nArriving at Madelyn's office after her return from a late-night meeting across town, he waited patiently as she packed her files into a briefcase, still working after a long day. \n\n\"Busy day?\" He asked, glancing at her overflowing case. \n\n\"Always is, Detective - high-conflict cases aren't known for their simplicity. Goes with the territory I suppose, and constant travelling to take care of these cases, of course,\", she sighed, heaving her bag onto her shoulder and motioning for Winston to follow her towards the elevator. \n\nIn the limbo between floors, Winston studied Madelyn. The fine lines creasing her forehead and the dull tiredness in her eyes spoke volumes of late nights in the office and constant travelling. \n\n\"Coffee?\" She asked, sitting heavily into her chair in the dimly lit room, motioning to a nearby coffee pot. \n\n\"No thanks, just want to be clear on some things,\" Winston said, refusing the siren call of caffeine. \n\n\"On that dagger incident, you mean? It's an antique from my collection. Some kind of sick joke, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Niche hobby, isn't it?\" Winston remarked calmly.\n\n\"History unfolds with every piece from the past – it's actually quite intriguing if you take the time to dive in,\" she replied, looking beyond Winston into her past with a distant gaze.\n\nConversation shifted to the late Abigail with a heavy tone, feeling more like a performance than genuine grief. Madelyn bitterly explained how the two of them used to be good friends until they fell out over a huge debt she unfortunately borrowed from Abigail. \n\n\"She was threatening to drag me to the court and make my debt public... Just imagine the public humiliation, \" she confessed with a shake of the head, her eyes reflecting a mixture of resentment and fear. \"And let’s not forget that winning lawsuit could’ve spelled financial ruin for me. It terrified me.\"\n\nIn the quiet of her office, the soft ticking of the clock echoed with each second. The room absorbed her words, casually dancing around the real question Winston was going to ask. Just as he was about to probe further, a distant melody caught his ear. The melody spelt jazz and Madelyn noticed his interest.\n\n\"The club? Oh, it's just about 10 minutes from here. I can hear them sometimes when I work late, or when I return from late-night meetings.\" Madelyn said, almost wistful. The jazz notes from distance seemed to play a mournful tribute for the late Abigail as Winston thanked Madelyn for her time and left her office.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Investigating the murder of Stuart gave him a bone-chilling sensation. The images of the crime scene fresh in his mind. But a crime scene found in a zoo? He needed answers.\n\nEntering the coffee shop where Xanthe worked as a barista, Winston could see several customers waiting in line. Apparently, their coffee was popular in town. Xanthe could be seen behind the bar, engaging her clients, before she gracefully hurried over to the espresso machine. In that hurry, she accidentally drops a piece of paper. A customer quickly pointed it out, and Winston intervened to pick it up. \n\n\"That looks like a list of phone numbers,\" the customer said, peering over Winston's shoulder and noticing the peculiar numbers. \"Those aren't usual business or personal contacts. I work in telecommunications, I know.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Xanthe said, acknowledging the mishap, before busying herself again. \n\nWinston headed to the bar but opted not to order anything. Instead, he scanned the fallen paper. The now identified phone numbers seemed quite out of place.  \n\nThe Zoo's visitor logs showed that Stuart was a regular, showing up daily. He made a mental note of that. There was certainly a connection between Stuart and the coffee shop...with the baristas. Stuart was seen being quite friendly with the baristas, including the newcomer, Mary, whom he praised quite often. \n\n\"Was Stuart a regular here?\" Winston asked Xanthe.\n\n\"Yes,\" She responded warmly, \"he loved our coffee. Always praised Mary's hand.. She's pretty good, new or not. But you know, I was the one who used to make his coffee. Had his special recipe down, I did,\" She added, pointing towards a different espresso machine designated for complicated orders.\n\n\"Oh, that's interesting. You must have a busy schedule,\" Winston said offhandedly.\n\n\"Oh yeah, it includes working weekends too,\" Xanthe said, giving off a slight chuckle.\n\nAs Winston left the coffee shop, he recalled that Stuart's murder happened on a weekend. Winston knew this wasn't a coincidence, there was a complex web of intrigue developing here, leading him deeper into the mystery.\n\nWinston stared at the emails on Stuart's computer screen, reading about the deep financial holes Lowell had dug for his bank’s high profile clients. The source of these emails was unidentified, but they were enough to start a full-scale fraud investigation. It appeared that the businessman had been trading emails with Stuart not too long ago. It wasn't too hard to figure out why Stuart might've been targeted.\n\nHe looked over the police report, his cigar glowing in the dim room. It was late afternoon when the banking industry slows its hustle and bustle, that Stuart was found at the zoo. It was also the same time Lowell had a bank meeting at the branch near the zoo, according to the calendar reminder from Lowell's heavily incriminating laptop.\n\nAs Winston took a break from the case files, sipped coffee, and thought about his next move, he knew he needed to get over to the lumber yard. The police had found some rather interesting pieces of evidence there. The man behind the desk at Lowell's bank vouched that he was a regular at the nearby lumber yard and had been for years. With an empty shed filled with sawdust and shards of wood at his home, it made sense where most of the firewood at Lowell's house came from.\n\nShuffling through the paperwork, Winston found a bank withdrawal receipt from Lowell's office. It was the bank near the zoo. The timing was convenient. As were the missing firewood logs from his backyard. The man certainly had spent a lot of time around there, in the late afternoon.\n\nThe next stop for Winston would be the café. Sure enough, the receipts and CCTV footage confirmed that Lowell was a regular there as well and was there around the same time Stuart was at the zoo.\n\nThe guy at the lumber yard confirmed that Lowell came in pretty frequently, mostly for firewood and sometimes for tools. Most recently, he had come in for a new hatchet, but he mentioned that his old hatchet was missing from his shed. Strange, considering the murder weapon was a hatchet and it just so happened to match the brand that Lowell usually favored.\n\nIn his search, Winston found Lowell's laptop at Stuart's apartment. Through Lowell's email exchanges and Stuart's search history, it became clear that Stuart had found evidence of Lowell's illegal banking operations. These were the same operations he had been contacting the unknown source about. And there were the emails from Stuart himself, asking for a substantial dollar figure to keep quiet.\n\nWinston looked at his notes. He had a lot of work ahead of him, but each interview, each piece of evidence, was knitting together the fabric for Stuart's murder. He ordered another coffee and made a list of questions for Lowell. He had an interesting day ahead of him.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Xanthe\nB.

Walter had been killed, and based on initial investigations, a nail gun was the suspected murder weapon. \n\nWinston set his gaze on the prime suspect...young Dennis. He had been a fixture around the city's construction sites for years, including the ongoing project at the zoo. Not long ago, Winston remembered seeing him at one of the sites brandishing a nail gun, securing beams and panels with confident gestures. \n\nAs he picked apart the crime scene, Winston found a receipt in one of the toolboxes. It was from a hardware store, listing a box of framing nails bought just a day before Walter's murder. \n\nWinston turned his attention to Dennis's background. Dennis feared Walter, who was known to be involved in some shady activities. Walter had tightened a threatening leash on the boy, often bullying him and warning him of severe consequences if Dennis did not follow his orders. Winston also recalled that Dennis had witnessed some of these activities as he was fostered by Walter. \n\nPushing further, Winston discovered that Dennis had been seen at a local hardware store the day before the attack, purchasing exactly the same nails as the ones on the receipt. \n\nDisentangling Dennis's post-work life, Winston uncovered a string of connections entwining Dennis with some dubious faces in town. Dennis was known to frequent 'The Pit,' a bar notorious for the wrong kind of patrons, where he was seen mingling with known gang members. \n\nIn a brief conversation he had with the boy, this grim picture was confirmed. \n\n\"The Pit? Yeah, I go there often. What's the big deal?\" shrugged Dennis, when Winston questioned him about his regular haunt and its denizens. \n\nWinston prodded further, \"Ever see anything out of the ordinary at The Pit, Dennis?\" \n\n\"What do you mean?\" Dennis asked, leaning back on his chair.\n\n\"Anything...unusual. Any fights, perhaps?\" \n\nDennis paused, \"I can hear arguments and fights from my apartment all the time. It's a tough neighborhood.\"\n\nWinston nodded. There had been three assaults reported just last month from that neighborhood - an uncomfortable backdrop to the unfortunate boy's daily life. \n\n\"Stay safe, kid.\" He told Dennis as they ended their conversation. His job, for now, was to dig further into the complex web surrounding Walter's murder.\n\nWinston was in the process of sifting through last month's court documents, ones that had been in Walter's possession. Specifically, Glenn's criminal record stood out among Walter's findings. The record spread over a period of eight years and exposed Glenn's previous stint in the prison.\n\nPromptly the next day, Winston decided to visit Glenn at work. The grocery store was bustling with activity as it was a grocery shopping day for most families in the neighborhood. As Glenn was ringing up a box of high-quality nails, typically used for a nail gun, for a customer, Winston noticed and waited patiently until Glenn got a break from his hectic day to approach him.\n\nGlenn looked surprised to see a customer waiting for him, \"Can I help you with something, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm Detective Winston.\" He showed his badge. \"I have a few questions for you.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Glenn replied hesitantly.\n\n\"Noticed you're in stock with a wide range of nails today,\" Winston pointed towards a packed shelf of nails.\n\n\"Yeah, people need them for all sorts of reasons,\" Glenn chuckled nervously. \"In fact, just purchased some for myself.\"\n\n\"Even for nail guns?\"\n\nGlenn looked a little startled, but quickly composed himself and replied, \"Certainly, sir. But we don't sell the nail guns themselves here.\"\n\nIn the middle of their conversation, a little girl came running up to Glenn excited. \"Daddy, Daddy, I want to go to the zoo again this Saturday! Can we go watch the monkeys get their feeding? They get fed at exactly three in the afternoon, same as every day, Please, Daddy!\"\n\n\"Sure, sweetheart. If that's what you want,\" Glenn smiled, looking fondly at his daughter. \"Our membership sure is getting a workout, isn't it?\"\n\nLater, Winston headed to the zoo himself. A regular he recognised from the grocery, noticed him and approached, \"You must be the detective. I saw you around the grocery that day. I've seen Glenn here as well, always around three for the monkey feeding. He and his daughter have a membership and visit often.\"\n\n\"Do you remember something about him on the day Walter was mur...\"\n\n\"Yes, actually. He was carrying a bulky bag. Quite similar to a tool bag if I remember correctly,\" the eyewitness replied, cutting him short.\n\nLater that evening, Winston visited Glenn's home, commenting on how well he repaired the leaky roof from last winter with his previous purchase of nails. \n\n\"You know what they say, a stitch in time saves nine,\" Glenn said, sounding more relaxed on his home ground. \n\nWinston managed to bring up Walter's conversation with him, \"I heard Walter found out something about your past?\" \n\nGlenn's smile faded, \"Yes, he did. And he told me couldn't keep his secret much longer,\" Glenn replied cautiously. \n\nWith that, Winston took leave, leaving a tense Glenn standing under the roof he had mended himself, feeling the sudden, icy gust of wintry winds.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The coroner's report indicated Ivan's time of death aligns perfectly with when Timothy, a self-professed herpetology enthusiast with extensive knowledge of acquiring and handling venom from his exotic snakes, had been at the studio. It had only been a few days, but the studio felt hauntingly empty. He turned his gaze to the padded wall, where someone had written, \"Timothy and Ivan, a deadly harmony.\"\n\nIt was here that Winston found a recorded conversation between Ivan and Timothy, where Ivan fiercely confronted Timothy about his secret affair with Ivan's girlfriend. \"You'll have hell to pay,\" Ivan had threatened in the recording. Clearly, Ivan was no longer a mere obstacle for Timothy, but a threat to his secret relationship that he wouldn't afford to get exposed.\n\nBack at headquarters, Winston found himself faced with Timothy in the interrogation room, a lanky lad with a laid-back demeanor of a surfing instructor. \"So, Timothy,\" began Winston trying to cut through the tension. \"You were at the recording studio on the day Ivan died, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah...\" Timothy played with the frayed edge of his board shorts, \"We were working on a music project, you know. I just... I had no idea he was gonna end up... like that.\"\n\n\"And no one else was at the studio then, I assume?\" Winston questioned calmly. Timothy merely nodded, his gaze fixed on the plain metal table between them.\n\nWinston pursued, \"I heard... something about Ivan confronting you about your secret affair with his girlfriend. That'd make anyone pretty jealous. And then you'd be afraid Ivan would reveal your secret, right?\" Silence followed as Timothy clenched his jaw tightly, hands nervously tightening into fists. His jealousy was evident, as was his fear of Ivan revealing their secret relationship.\n\nLater that day, Winston found himself wandering down to a strange, exotic animal shop in the city. The shopkeeper, a wiry man with spectacles, recognized Timothy from a photograph. Timothy frequented the place, purchasing his exotic snakes from here - not just for their beauty but also for the lethal venom some of them could produce.\n\n\"They're beautiful creatures,\" the shopkeeper remarked, \"Can be really dangerous though. Timothy knows that. He spends hours studying them and knows exactly how to handle them and their venom.\"\n\nWinston nodded, thoughts racing in his mind. The timeline was starting to line up... Ivan confronted Timothy about his affair with his girlfriend, resulting in Timothy becoming jealous. With his advanced knowledge of venom and snakes, Timothy could have easily silenced Ivan forever. As he walked out of the store, Winston looked back at the snakes. Their eyes gleamed ominously under the warm lights, a dangerous secret they shared with their owner.\n\nDetective Winston stared at the envelope in his hands. It contained a recording of a man's voice... Ricky's voice. Ricky had confessed to engaging in illegal activities at the pet shop he owned during a one-on-one meeting with Ivan, an incriminating evidence towards Ricky. Ivan, Ricky's employee, had managed to record this meeting and now was using it to blackmail his boss. Ivan was the sole possessor of such damning evidence against Ricky. The envelope addressed to Ivan had been found amongst the many other envelopes from anonymous senders that overloaded Ricky's mail box daily. Winston sighed, mentally checking off the initial facts.\n\nStepping inside the pet shop, Winston noted Ricky, the man who was visibly apprehensive. He was holding onto something, something that spelled danger. Ricky owned a venomous snake- his trusted companion. Winston's eyes narrowed visibly, remembering Ricky's well-versed knowledge of venom extraction. But right now, his attention was more focused on the legal documents that lay strewn about the table. The pet shop was in his name, and the blackmail was threatening ruin, both financially and legally.\n\nSuddenly, Ricky moved. He pulled open a drawer bursting with wigs, glasses, and an assortment of props. Instantly, Winston recalled the photograph he received from a witness, who had spotted Ricky at a passport photo shop. The picture showed Ricky surrounded by various props, similar to the ones he now held in his hands. Ricky seemed to be prepared for every eventuality, but why? Winston kept his thoughts to himself, focusing on the task at hand.\n\nRicky moved around the room, apparently agitated. Winston asked him mundane questions, like how his day had been, what his work involved. Ricky, nervous though he was, responded readily. Soon, minutes turned into hours as the detective–suspect duo sat locked in an interrogation that was as much unspoken as spoken. The room still held the echo of Ivan's lethal poisoning, and with each word uttered, Ricky painted a complex canvas; a canvas depicting a secretive life of illegal activities, desperate actions, and an existence losing coherence amidst the deceit.\n\nWinston knew, the mystery was far from solved. There were still layers to Ricky that needed to be peeled back. He knew he had a tough task ahead with numerous clues left to be discovered. As he exited the pet shop door, he bade farewell to a day filled with questioning and welcomed an impending journey of uncloaking the truth.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Inside was Sophie, his latest person of interest, who had gained notoriety for expressing racist viewpoints at several social gatherings. Witnesses and victims had come forth, stating that Sophie, in her fury, had confronted and threatened individuals belonging to the groups she so openly expressed prejudice against.\n\nSophie, who was known for her athletic prowess as a professional trident thrower, was amid an intense workout when Winston entered the facility. She was preparing for an upcoming competition, her muscles rippling under the strain of each precise throw. Her unlimited access to the gym's professional equipment made this process much easier.\n\nWinston approached her once she finished her practice throws. \"Ms. Sophie,\" he greeted, his gaze unwavering.\n\nShe turned, her eyes blazing with a competitive energy. \"Detective Winston,\" she replied. \"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Maybe. I'm asking around about a gym guest, Stephen. He was part of your clientele, wasn't he?\" He knew the answer, having found that Stephen visited this gym regularly.\n\nSophie's expression hardened. \"Yes,\" she confirmed. \"So what?\"\n\n\"Stephen has been murdered in the library downtown.\" Winston noticed Sophie's eyes flicker with surprise, or guilt perhaps. Sophie knew Stephen's routine well. His unusual, long hours spent at the library coincided with the time of the crime, a detail Sophie was well aware of. \n\nSophie looked genuinely shocked. \"Library?\" she echoed, her brows furrowing.\n\n\"Yes, the library. Quite an unusual scene, isn't it? Especially when we found a trident near his body. It happens to be identical to the kind here in your gym,\" Winston added.\n\nImmediately, Sophie blanched. She swiveled her head towards the impressive array of trident equipment, nervously mimicking a laugh. “A trident?” she repeated, “Yes… we do have tridents here for… for our clients.”\n\nWinston changed his line of questioning. \"Stephen belonged to a particular minority group, didn't he? One I've heard which you've openly threatened and discriminated against at several social events. Isn't that so?\"\n\nSophie, visibly taken aback, struggled to reply, \"I...I have...expressed my views at some social gatherings,\" she stammered out, her face reddening. \"But what's that got to do with Stephen?\"\n\n\"Well, knowing when Stephen would be at the library,\" Winston began, \"and considering your skill with tridents, the weapon implicated in the crime – I just thought it could be worth looking into.\"\n\nWith those parting words, Winston left the bewildered Sophie in silence inside the gym. This first encounter provided him with more than enough to investigate Sophie further.\n\nWinston found himself at the local train station, a place he often found solace in the comings and goings of people from all walks of life. It was here he knew he would locate Lowell, his next interviewee in regards to Stephen's untimely demise.\n\nLowell had been the delivery driver for the library's regular book shipments for some time now, making the morning deliveries under the cloaking silence of the pre-dawn air. As Winston deployed his questions, Lowell casually mentioned that his route included the town where the library was. Winston noted the tired dullness in Lowell's eyes as he mentioned his raise from the delivery company - it seemed like the numbing monotony of the job had not changed, nor had Lowell's general lack of enthusiasm about it.\n\nThe topic of the recent train accident came up, and what Winston found peculiar was Lowell's nonchalant response to it. Despite the usual shock and upset that strikes most people after such incidents, Lowell appeared almost unfazed, as if it were just another everyday occurrence clashing against his jaded facade.\n\nWinston followed up on an evening invitation for a soiree at Lowell's house. This wasn't his usual cup of tea, but he knew it was an opportunity to further explore Lowell's world. The conductor's soirées were known for their unique purpose - showcasing his collection of antiquities, curiosities of historical relevance, and one particular item that never failed to impress. \n\nLowell's fascination with weapons was widely known, but his pride was his trident, an instrument whose history and significance he appeared to comprehend in great depth. The antiquated weapon was a focal point of fascination among his guests, a point of conversation that led to their visible amazement.\n\nWhile at the soirée, Winston overheard a brief interaction between Lowell and another attendee. The person congratulated Lowell on his raise, expressed condolences for a colleague's recent loss, and inquired about his frequent early morning deliveries to the library. Despite the layered complexities of the conversation, Lowell appeared untroubled, revealing no physical signs of sadness or empathy, and mentioned the solitary nature of his early morning deliveries. Small talk it may have seemed, these snippets of conversation provided Winston with yet another view into the intricate, strange life of Lowell.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

He remembered her as a skilled bartender at a high-end restaurant, famed for her unique way of handling a corkscrew, especially while opening extravagant wine bottles. Recently, she seemed to have been working outside of normal working hours. She was often seen requesting financial support from Frederick, an affluent regular customer who wouldn't mind doling out his means for attention.\n\nA friend once mentioned to him Frederick’s intention to spill the beans about Tessa's grim reality. It was not every day someone aimed to settle a debt of that size, and the situation intrigued Winston. Using the information he had, he traced that Tessa had checked in the motel a couple of days before Frederick’s demise.\n\nWinston pulled his sedan into the dusty lot of the low-rise motel on the outskirts of town. There he saw Tessa, emerging from a room and handing a key back to the motel manager. The motel staff confirmed that the implicating room was indeed paid for by Tessa, and their logbook showed that she had checked in before Frederick’s death. They also agreed that she had remained on the premises throughout.\n\nThe day Tessa was arrested, she displayed her usual calm demeanor. As the police handcuffed her, a metallic shine of a corkscrew slipped out from her apron pocket, landing on the ground below. This was her personal corkscrew, a tool she always had on hand for her routine work at the restaurant, and one that she was seen using frequently to open wine bottles during her shift.\n\nAs Winston left the motel to return to the precinct, he mused over the victim’s connection with Tessa. Frederick knew about Tessa’s considerable debt, and this was not ordinary behavior between a server and a regular patron. But for now, the facts just laid out the circumstances. His sole contribution to this puzzle would be to compile the facts so they could make sense. The rest — the swift execution of justice — was a matter of time. And Winston knew that time always brought the truth to light.\n\nWinston straightened his tie as he approached the scene of Frederick's murder, squinting under the motel's harsh fluorescent lighting. Frederick, a successful events planner, was stealing lucrative contracts right from Van’s territory. On the other hand, Van also managed to poach a few of Frederick's prime clients. Frederick's competitors saw his success as the rising spark of a problem they had to deal with. Someone like Van, maybe. \n\nVan. The one who was always behind a desk at every event he planned, for some reason avoiding any kind of physical exertion. For instance, at every event, he could be found refusing a spot in the robust, physically-demanding relay races that colleagues customarily participated in. That night was no different, the event was a wine tasting. Van would likely be there, not participating in the traditional grape-stomping competition. There, Van would flaunt his newly-acquired clients; the ones he had usurped from Frederick.\n\nWith this thought in his head, Winston drove over to the event, arriving to the sight of Van pouring wine expediently with a corkscrew for the event attendees instead of joining in on the active games. \n\n\"Van,\" Winston greeted, nodding at him.\n\n\"Detective,\" Van replied, raising an eyebrow. \n\nHe paused as Winston took a seat in front of him, then offered a bottle of red. \"Wine, Detective?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" Winston said, \"Don't you usually have an assistant to open wine bottles?\"\n\nVan laughed, shrugging off the observation easily. \"I like doing it. It's therapeutic,\" he said.\n\nThen there was the fresh dressing peeking out from under Van's cuff, the one he offered some vague explanation for, just like every other time Winston had seen him injured. He referred to these as ‘small accidents’.\n\nHe remembered what Van's colleagues had said about him. Always getting injured, never playing in any games, always behind a desk, and there was that thing with Frederick. \n\n\"Frederick,\" Winston started, both men looking somber at the mention of the recent murder. Van averted his gaze, focusing steadfastly on the bottle he was opening.\n\n\"I heard you had a falling out.\"\n\nVan sighed, and for the first time that evening he looked tired. \"Fred and I... we had our differences. He was snatching clients right under my nose. And I wasn't just taking it lying down, I got back at him by snatching some of his clients,” he confessed. \n\n\"Heard you even threatened him once,\" Winston said quietly.\n\n\"That was just business, nothing personal,\" Van replied coldly. \"If you're suggesting--\"\n\nWinston lifted his hands, chuckling lightly. \"I'm not suggesting anything, Van,\" he said carefully.\n\nTurning his attention back to the bottle, Van popped the cork and poured himself a glass. \"Fine. I had my disagreements with Frederick,\" he admitted. \"Yes, we threatened each other over clients. But that's all it was... just threats.\"\n\nWinston left shortly after, leaving Van to his wine and his thoughts. As he walked back to the car, he remembered the coroner's report. Those puncture wounds in Frederick's autopsy. Consistent with a corkscrew... \n\nA steady cold rain fell on Winston's windshield as he drove away, leaving behind the warm lights of the wine tasting event and a man with a lot on his mind.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

He observed Mackenzie through his binoculars, watching closely as they hastily unlocked their front door. It had been a long day at the office for Mackenzie and, like clockwork, they were seen taking their customary break on a public bench, working on their laptop.\n\nBefore long, Mackenzie was seen through the partially closed blinds of their apartment, sitting at their desk with their laptop open. They had just returned from a local cyber security meetup, a reality Winston discovered after following Mackenzie to the event later that evening. As Winston watched, they shifted their body and their eyes darted around, Winston duly noted on Mackenzie's apparent concern for online privacy.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston thought, while making a mental note to do some research on further cyber security meetups occurring in the vicinity.\n\nThe next morning, Winston watched Mackenzie walk out of a martial arts training center. As Mackenzie stopped to say goodbye to their instructor, Winston quickly snapped a photo on his phone. In the picture, Winston could clearly see Mackenzie practicing techniques with the unmistakable form of Mackenzie's sturdy nunchaku resting in the backdrop. This gave Winston a clue that his martial arts training includes nunchaku techniques.\n\nWinston's interest peaked further when he followed Mackenzie to a local shop where they were seen purchasing a new set of nunchaku. Even more intriguing was when they examined a pair of cufflinks on display with a yearning look, cufflinks Winston knew were identical to a pair Mack frequently flaunted around. It appeared Mack had things that Mackenzie also desired.\n\nThe investigator decided it was time to pay Mackenzie a visit. He knocked on the apartment door and Mackenzie cautiously invited him in.\n\nPleasantries were briefly exchanged before Winston's gaze quickly fell on the laptop that was resting by some papers next to an open window.\n\n\"You always take this with you to work?\" Winston inquired, pointing at the laptop.\n\n\"Every day,\" Mackenzie replied, \"I can't leave my work at the office.\"\n\n\"Work goes that well, huh?\" Winston probed further. \"I hear you were recently ... overlooked for a promotion.\"\n\nAt these words, Mackenzie's expression darkened. \"I was the top candidate, you know. It should've been mine. Mack, the new guy, he is nothing compared to me, but he takes it. That promotion, the respect I had. Even those cufflinks I have always wanted, somehow Mack always gets to have them.\"\n\nWinston nodded, making a mental note of Mackenzie's reaction. They turned the conversation to martial arts and during the chat, Mackenzie unintentionally revealed their prowess with nunchaku.\n\nIn a small, hidden compartment in Mackenzie's wardrobe, Winston found the pair of nunchaku that Mackenzie had recently purchased. He swiftly snapped a picture of this evidence before closing the wardrobe.\n\nAs the day grew late, Winston thanked Mackenzie for their time and headed out, feeling more certain than ever about the path his investigation was following.\n\nWinston sat in his office, photos of Mack --the bungee jumper found dead-- scattered heartbreakingly across his desk. The lack of clues at the murder site puzzled him, nothing seemed out of place. All he had was an unusual weapon, the nunchaku, not something he’d found at too many crime scenes.\n\nStanding up, he straightened his tie and headed to the shared housing complex of the victim and suspect. Ana Diaz lived here, along with Mack. Ground rules for questioning the suspect were laid out in his mind.\n\nAna received him with a stoic expression and invited him inside. Her suitcase was unpacked, strewn helter-skelter around the room. She explained she had come back from the bungee jumping site late last night, still in shock about Mack’s murder.\n\nNunchaku lay on the table. Winston noticed, she explained it as the normal household item of a martial artist. She said she practices martial arts at the same bungee jumping location. \n\nAsked about their shared occupation, she sighed heavily. “Mack loved it, though,\" She said, \"He was the instigator, insisting everyone take the jump.”\n\nAna seemed to soften, talking about her faith, her traditions. “Bungee jumping, it's against my beliefs,” she admitted, “but I’d signed up too, expecting some ridicule like always.”\n\nRidicule. That was a word Winston had already heard before concerning Mack. He asked around, among their friends, everyone said the same, Mack liked to joke, to point fun at beliefs. Especially Ana’s it seemed.\n\nThey left together, Ana and Mack, the morning of the murder, people had seen them. Winston asked why, given their strained relationship. Ana shrugged off, her hands trembling. “He wasn’t too bad,” she replied. \n\nNobody else was documented at the bungee jumping site that day, only Mack and Ana. It was time to head there. Winston thanked Ana for her time and left, driving straight to the scene. He stared up at the looming diving board, picturing the scene.  \n\nOnly two people there that day, Mack and Ana. He looked around, the martial arts practice ground nearby held the last piece. Nunchaku, a common weapon in martial arts practices. He tested one, the weight fitting neatly into his palm while he surveyed the area. This was the scene he needed to piece together.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The victim this time: Stephen, a courageous investigative reporter who had made one too many enemies during his pursuit of justice. Stephen had earned a name investigating and exposing illicit activities; his fearless revelations were the talk of multiple towns and cities. The crime scene was peculiar – a library, out of all places on Earth. The murder weapon? A trident.\n\nEvery homicide case left a trail, breadcrumbs that could help Winston form a faint skeleton of who the murderer might be. This time, all paths utterly and confusingly led toward Lowell, the town’s train conductor. A well-known character in his community, Lowell held soirées where he proudly displayed his many antiquities, captivating everyone with his wide collection.\n\nThat morning, after gulping down the last dregs of his lukewarm coffee, Winston geared up to pay a visit to Lowell. Lowell was a true bibliophile; this interest took him to the library often, delivering books even before the other staff arrived, quite a regular morning ritual.\n\n\"What's so captivating about these old items, Lowell?\" one guest had asked at one of his soirées. With a glint in his eyes, Lowell had lifted his most prized possession, an antique trident. The reaction he garnered from his circle of acquaintances was always a mix of awe and hypnotic fascination. This was a man with a peculiar admiration for weapons, with tridents being his favourite, much to the fascination and marvel of his acquaintances.\n\nApproaching the train station, the sound of an incoming train echoed through the high-ceilinged building. \n\n“You must be Lowell,\" Winston began, approaching the rail-thin man, who was tending to a run-down stack of worn-out books.\n\n\"Indeed I am. And you are?\" Lowell responded with a tired smile, turning his attention to the dark-suited man.\n\n“Detective Winston. I’m here to know more about your routes,” he asked, observing Lowell's weary face. Lowell’s train route famously covered numerous towns, quietly snaking through quaint little outposts and bustling cities, one of which contained the library where Stephen met his untimely demise.\n\nLowell's tired eyes turned sorrowful at the mention of Stephen, the brave reporter who had been closing in on his fraudulent trading of antiquities. In fact, Stephen was known for his uncanny ability to unearth and expose illegal activities, and Lowell's illegal trading was on his latest docket. This left Lowell in a precarious position and drowning in debt.\n\nWinston held onto these observations, looking into the future with a firm resolve to expose the truth. What he had seen today was just a tip of the iceberg. But as they say, time would tell.\n\nWinston didn't quite understand why anyone would want to throw a trident. But then again, Winston didn't understand a lot of things. He didn't understand why Stephen had been murdered in a library with a trident. And he didn't understand why Sophie, a personal trainer preparing for a trident throwing competition, seemed so vague when discussing her knowledge of Stephen.\n\n\"Stephen was at my gym a lot,\" Sophie remarked off-handedly as she loaded weights onto a barbell. \"But we weren't exactly buddies or anything.\"\n\nA few of the other gym-goers tried to engage Sophie on this topic during breaks in their workouts, to no avail. All her clients tried, but none were able to get her to discuss this topic. She expertly brushed them off, returning each time to her task. \"My clients and I rarely talk about anything that's not workout related.\"\n\n\"Several of your clients mentioned they've tried to friend you on Facebook and follow you on Instagram, but you never respond,\" Winston pointed out. Her cold expression gave him the answer he expected. She's seen each request and deliberately left them pending. \n\n\"Typical. Social media? I see all messages and requests, but I find it... cumbersome.\" Sophie admitted, a flicker of annoyance crossing her face as she adjusted her weight lifting gloves.\n\nWinston glanced at the vast array of equipment laid out across the gym. \"Stephen told me you were a formidable competitor. He was a big fan of trident throwers.\"\n\nSophie smirked at the comment. \"Well, I am quite a pro at trident throwing.\"\n\nA beat of silence passed, and Winston asked, \"Did you know Stephen spent a lot of time in the library?\"\n\nFor what seemed like the first time since Winston had walked in, Sophie looked away. \"I knew his routine alright - gym during the day, library in the evenings. He and I, we didn't talk much... about anything outside the gym. I even knew he'd be at the library that evening of the crime.\"\n\nSophie's admission startled Winston. \"You knew he'd be at the library that evening?\"\n\nSophie only shrugged, her voice filled with indifference, \"Stephen and his books. Everyone knew about his library habits. Especially that evening.\"\n\nWinston suspiciously eyed the trident that was resting against the wall of the gym. A trident... just like the one found at the murder scene. \"That trident over there... Is it yours?\"\n\nSophie glanced at it and shrugged, \"Yeah, it's from here. I and the others have unlimited access to the gym equipment.\"\n\nIn the end, Winston left the gym with more questions than answers, as Sophie went back to preparing for her competition.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

As his long evening unfolded, he was parked outside a well-lit room; light emanating from a window. This was Claire's room, which her neighbor distinctly mentioned lights up late into the night when Claire is at her computer. \n\nAccording her neighbor and to her own roommate, Claire is one who never leaves her room whenever she engages in her internet activities, a detail that struck the detective as particularly strange. \n\nClaire, who happened to be a secretary by day and a waitress at a local restaurant by night, had been on Winston's radar since the case was assigned to him. The restaurant was also coincidentally the murder scene.\n\nAs Winston approached her front door, he couldn't help but notice the enclosed garden, embellished with a line of barbed wire for added security. It was an unusual choice of boundary protection for a garden, but it held a surreal beauty in the moonlight. \n\n\"Claire's gardening was a hobby she fancied in her free time,\" a neighbor once mentioned, adding that she was adept at handling the barbing without ever having an injury, a skill that had surprised many.\n\nIn their brief conversation, her roommate had mentioned the elusive yet frequent late-hour typing noises coming from her room and how suddenly they would stop whenever she tried to enter.\n\n\"I always found it strange. She would immediately shut her laptop, and I didn't really see what she was working so late into the night. It wasn't like her,\" the roommate remarked. \n\n\"All these late-night activities don't necessarily mean any harm,\" Winston murmured to himself.\n\nAs the evening progressed, Winston found out from the restaurant's janitor that there was ongoing construction by the restaurant. The presence of the surplus barbed wire stockpile meant that it was a common sight in their vicinity.\n\nRenee, the victim, was more to Claire than just an overseer at the restaurant. Renee, amidst her work, had unexpectedly stumbled upon Claire's illegal embezzlement activities linked to the restaurant's funds. Word was, she was about to expose these allegations, which would have undoubtedly cost Claire her job and possibly lead to incarceration.\n\nAs Winston drove back, battling an oncoming headache, he lit up a cigarette. The day had been long, crammed with ongoing conversations filled with facts and stories. As he watched the ember crush under his boot, his instincts whispered that there was a long path ahead before he could find resolution.\n\nWinston sat down at his desk, shuffling through the case files. The file named 'Renee' seemed to be the one that took his interest. He pulled out the notes from the coroner's office; Renee had been found some time earlier at the two-Michelin-starred L'etoile Restaurant.\n\nShrugging on his coat, Winston walked toward the door, picking up the file enroute. He hailed a cab and slipped the driver an address halfway across town; the scene of the murder - a now-closed luxury restaurant.\n\nInside, a crowd had made the regular police's work a little more difficult. Separating potential suspects from huddling, shocked patrons was decidedly hard. \n\nWinston walked up to a uniformed officer and learnt from him that a crowd of people were dining at the restaurant when the crime was committed; among them was a woman named Isla.\n\nA trip to her house later, Winston found himself in front of a woman with an achingly passionate love for her favorite music group. He couldn't help but notice a collection of survival tools on a nearby rack reflecting the afternoon sunlight. As he browsed, he found several open tabs on her computer that linked to various tutorials and forums about survival skills. It was known to him, from a previous informant, that Isla had been learning survival skills through those online sources. He remembered learning earlier that Isla had defended her home against an intruder with a piece of barbed wire once.\n\nAs he was about to leave, he noticed a receipt on the coffee table. It was from a local hardware store barely a day old and listed 'barbed wire' as one of the items.\n\nIsla showed Winston out of the house, all the while talking passionately about her favorite music group. They were up for the same award that Renee's group ultimately won. \"It ain't fair, you know?\" she complained. \"My boys deserved it, not them.\"\n\nA canvas of previous police reports showed that she had been in a couple of discrimination lawsuits. Neighbors had heard her speak poorly of Renee's culture.\n\nWinston made his way back to L'etoile Restaurant. The manager handed him the reservations book. Renee had booked a table for the night of her death. Not far from her entry was another name that seemed all too familiar - Isla.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The deceased, Peyton, was found with a gruesome hatchet wound deep in the heart of the rainforest.\n\nWhile sorting through the information at hand, Winston recalled a bit of crucial info about the suspect - Bruce, Peyton's partner in their shared illicit business. Bruce had mentioned that the day Peyton was found, he had been alone in the rainforest. A rumored confession and potential surrender by Peyton, and the stolen goods Peyton found stashed away, kept echoing in Winston's mind.\n\nAs the detective stepped away from the lamenting scene, he called in to schedule an interview with the partner, Bruce. He was known to visit the rainforest often, sometimes for solitude, sometimes under the guise of his illicit activities.\n\nMeeting Bruce at the entrance to the rainforest the following day, Winston sized him up. Nothing about his demeanor suggested guilt. Despite fearing the legal consequences of his actions, there was a calm about Bruce. For someone raised in the rainforest, he seemed one with the environment, he was comfortable in it.\n\nWinston asked Bruce about his usual activities in his favorite retreat, prompting him to say, \"I usually just like to be alone here, sir. A few chops here and there with my hatchet helps maintain the paths and keeps me busy.\"\n\nBruce’s answer inclined Winston to inquire, “And where is this hatchet now?” \n\nWith a frown, Bruce replied, “I couldn’t find it today, sir. I usually keep it well maintained and in its usual spot.”\n\nTheir talk was interrupted by a passerby, jogging down a path. After briefly chatting about the area and visitor trends they noticed, the jogger mentioned that they hadn't seen anyone else in the rainforest that particular day, let alone someone leaving. The jogger left. Bruce turned back to Winston and shared, \"Nobody usually notices me here, even when leaving the rainforest. It’s quite secluded.”\n\nThe thought of Peyton's gruesome death by the hatchet wound came back to Winston's mind. He abruptly thanked Bruce for his time and walked away.\n\nThe rainforest echoed with the weighted silence of the untold, and, as Winston ventured back to the city, a haunting thought lingered. The quiet, confident Bruce, with his missing hatchet, was confirmed to have been alone the last day Peyton was seen alive, and as the jogger had informed, unseen when he left the rainforest; the same day Peyton died.\n\nWinston examined the manifest from Norris's ferry one final time. It matched up with what he already knew: Peyton had indeed been aboard Norris's ferry on the day he was killed. Winston took one last look at the document before folding it and tucking it away into his coat pocket.\n\nNorris, the ferry captain, had a reputation amongst the barflies at his favorite local watering hole. They'd often overheard him detailing possibly too realistic scenes from the books they discussed at his thriller murder novel themed book club. Norris would get into specifics that made the members uncomfortable, his eyes often taking on an excited shine while he spoke of these gruesome and too-detailed-to-be-fiction murder scenes.\n\nTapping his notepad with a worn-down pen, Winston glanced up as Norris approached. Clad in his usual captain's garb and appearing a bit rough around the edges from years of running the ferry. Norris acted as the key traveling back and forth to the local rainforest, the last known place Peyton was seen alive.\n\n\"Captain Norris?\" Winston asked, even though he already knew the answer. Norris nodded in confirmation, his steady gaze meeting Winston's. \"Been doing this job for years,\" Norris said, a hint of pride reflected in his voice.\n\n\"It's a sturdy vessel you have,\" Winston commented as he gestured towards the ferry, his eyes landing on a standalone toolbox propped up near the bow. One item in particular stood out from the rest— a hatchet, well-used and worn, clear evidence of its frequent use in the maintenance of the ship under Norris's experienced hands.\n\n\"Ah, yes. That's Gertrude,\" Norris responded, referencing the hatchet, drawing Winston's attention back to him. Considering he was the only ferry giving rides to that rainforest, it was crucial Norris kept the ferry in good shape.\n\nWinston then redirected the conversation, \"We have a record of a Peyton. Took your ferry to the rainforest on the day of the murder. Anything you recall?\"\n\nNorris took a moment to recall, his brow furrowing in concentration. \"Hmm... Peyton? Yeah, sure. He was one of my passengers that day.\"\n\nAfter a few more hours of questioning, Winston returned to his squad car. The rainforest still lay heavy in his mind, and Peyton was a name he would not forget. But for now, he had everything he could glean from Norris, the ferry captain. His path forward would have to reveal itself in time.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Bruce\nB.

Normally, such places teemed with just the right amount of carefree chaos, but today, it was grimly silent.\n\nIn his hands were the materials concerning a woman named Abigail, who played host to a series of intriguing coincidences. She had been present in the very same laser tag room as Jacqueline when the fatal incident occurred, and rightly so - she was a volunteer for the charity event hosted by this venue. The fact that no other individuals - other than the unfortunate victim and Abigail - had gained entry to the room at the moment in question did arouse some intrigue.\n\nThe detective proceeded to visit the local zoo, intending to interrogate Abigail. It was here that she worked delicately within the reptile exhibit. During the conversation, Abigail let slip that she had recently been to a seminar on venom extraction, a fact that aligned ominously well with the fact that the lethal dose of venom involved in the case was sourced from a snake. Winston made sure to note in the ledgers that the zoo housed a few snakes famed for packing some notably potent venom.\n\nAs he delved deeper into Abigail's profile, he discovered previously unknown challenges. The lady seemed keen to keep her financial struggle under wraps. Her house payments had been consistently late - he quickly connected it to a recent incident wherein she had gone to pawn a valuable family heirloom. \n\nDuring a casual digging into Abigail's cyber history, Winston discovered that she had been looking up life insurance policies - how they unfolded, and how they reciprocated after the policy holder's unfortunate demise. Once more, a circumstance which had the potential to open up some conjecture: Jacqueline had, indeed, changed her life insurance policy beneficiary a few months back, and the new beneficiary was none other than - you guessed it.\n\n“Life’s expensive, isn't it?” Winston mentioned, trying to coax her into admitting to her fiscal struggles. Abigail just nodded, her gaze distant.\n\nFinishing his conversation, Winston decided it was time to leave. Just as he was walking away, Abigail called out to him, pointing to a serpent slithering in a terrarium. She began to relay some information about snake venom, the extraction process, and how surprisingly easy it would be to perform such an extraction.\n\nStories were quickly unraveled, intertwining closer than he initially assumed. As Winston walked away from the zoo, he couldn't help but notice the unshakeable belief that the logic of the world had its way of turning in full circles. After all, Jacqueline's team had signed up for the charity event at the laser tag arena... the very event that led her to her untimely end.\n\nWinston expelled a cloud of smoke from his lips as he gazed at the neon-lit steel doors of the laser tag arena. The once lively hub of fun and games now secured by crime scene tape, a grim murder mystery looming ominously around every corner.\n\nBy the entrance, a young singer by the name of Veronica was nervously waiting, her fingers fiddling with the fringes of her coat as Winston approached. There was a peculiar untouchability about her, evident in how she retreated to the corners and refused to attend social events, preferring instead to stay home practicing singing and performing, focusing her waking hours on her career.\n\n\"Singer, eh?\" Winston began, keen on learning more about this aloof character, \"Must be a very exhausting lifestyle.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" she answered, her focus still on the ground. \"No time to really get to know anyone, not even a close friend.\"\n\nHer response reminded Winston of what her friends had reported: Veronica's constant rejection when they tried to deepen their friendship with her. It was clear she had no time for love or friendship in her hectic life.\n\nBefore this occupation though, Winston had learned, Veronica used to work at a snake farm in her younger years. Intriguingly, she even performed at a show near the snake farm just a week before this murder had occurred. \n\nThe snake farm, he had discovered, reported a missing venomous snake days after Veronica's show. This became even more intriguing considering Veronica's unusual interest in snake venom - she had written a research paper on it once.\n\nVeronica's social encounters were fraught with tension, particularly with Jacqueline. Winston recalled hearing about their argument at a party centered around their differing nationalities. Veronica had publicly insulted Jacqueline's nationality during a performance too, a clear result of her prejudice which she had made public on more than one occasion. \n\n\"What happened with Jacqueline at the party, Veronica? Seems like you two had a fallout?\" Winston asked.\n\nVeronica shifted uncomfortably. \"It was just a disagreement,\" she stammered. \"She didn’t understand my point of view and…\" her voice trailed off.\n\n\"You made it public too, during your performance?\" Winston probed. He could see Veronica was taken aback, but didn't flinch.\n\n\"Look, my insults were directed at her nationality,” Veronica snapped, her filters slipping. “But that doesn’t mean I'm a… you know.\"\n\nWinston nodded. This was a detective's job after all, to uncover the stories behind the stories, regardless of how inexcusable they might sound.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Daisy wasn't your typical suspect - she was a singer who always had a passion for her art form, a passion that stood in sharp contrast with her family's dismissive attitude.\n\n“I'm just trying to get ahead in life, you know?\" she told Winston as they sat in a small cafe near one of her repeat performance venues - an old building that was frequently harshly criticised for its lack of cleanliness. \"They never cared about my music… always thought it was just a phase. I couldn't stand their lack of support.”\n\nGetting rid of her family members from her contacts was, as she put it, a \"cleansing experience\". It was all very telling of Daisy's meticulous nature - she extended the same cleanliness philosophy to everything in her personal life, hygiene being her top priority; it gave a stark contrast to the venues in which she performed.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, she casually added, \"Sometimes my sarcasm gets the best of me. I can't tell you how many family dinners I've ruined with it. My sarcasm stings so hard, it often leaves them in tears.\"\n\nWinston thought about Rose, who often parked her car in the same vicinity. \"You were scheduled to perform at a place near that parking lot that day… right?\" he asked. Daisy affirmed the fact and mentioned having seen Rose's car, acknowledging that she and Rose were the last two people in the vehicle after her show that night.\n\nAs part of her performances, Daisy often integrated different kinds of acid into her routines - the same kind, as it turned out, that had been used to murder Rose. A cold chill ran down Winston’s spine as he mentally cross-checked the evidence list.\n\n“Acid isn’t a typical instrument for a singer, Daisy...\" Winston quizzed, trying to keep the conversation casual. Daisy just shrugged, \"Got to create a spectacle, right? Attract an audience?”\n\nDaisy had always been adamant about not attending any family gatherings - a fact that did not change even after Rose’s death. But she claimed to hold no ill-will towards Rose. As Winston got up from the table to leave, he turned one final time to look at Daisy who was now alone and engrossed in her phone. A suspect or not, one thing was certain, the story was far from over.\n\nAs Winston sat in his office, he sifted through the photos of the crime scene. The car where Rose had met her gruesome end was familiar to him - it was the one Dexter had sold her just a few days ago. He recalled the witness statement he had received, stating that Dexter and Rose were seen driving off in the new car together on the day of the sale.\n\nA few days prior, he had stopped by the car dealership for a chat with Dexter. The man was always excitable, energetic - the sort of person you'd expect to be selling cars. But beneath that facade, Winston had glimpsed an undertone of tension. A hint of worry, perhaps? He remembered too the bold campaign posters dotting the walls of the showroom - 'Dexter for Office' they proclaimed, his smiling face lit up by the flash of a professional camera. Maintaining a decent public image was crucial for his campaign.\n\n\"Beautiful machine, ain't she?\" Dexter had commented, patting the bonnet of the vehicle with an almost reverential air. His eyes had been bright as he spoke, \"Takes skill to appreciate such precision and quality.\"\n\nA brief moment of silence had hung over them before Winston mentioned Rose. Instantly, the twitch in Dexter's smile was noticeable as he forced a chuckle, \"She got a good deal on this one. I even had a ride in it with her, that's what earned her trust.\"\n\nAs a detective, one didn't always have the luxury of trusting words at face value. Dexter seemed too polished - too adept at projecting an image. Most importantly, Winston had known about his run for the local office. A scandal was not what he needed. Rose had found out about Dexter's false credentials, and threatened him with exposure.\n\nWinston also remembered the demure set of eyes that stared back at him from an old campus photo during a visit to Dexter's home. Dexter had a degree in Chemistry. Neat rows of labeled chemicals stood proudly on a shelf in his private garage. The detective recognized some of them from his own time in the forensics lab. He had seen the vials labeled 'Acid'. Winston had asked Dexter about the key trace elements for his car sales. Dexter had just brushed it off with a laugh, mentioning they were required for cleaning and various other mundane tasks around the sales lot.\n\nBack at his office, the image of the second set of car keys on Dexter's table resurfaced in his mind. Dexter had explained them as a precaution, an insurance if customers ever lost their keys.\n\n\"Coffee?\" Winston's assistant knocked on his office door, pulling him out of his thoughts.\n\n\"No thanks,\" the detective replied, scribbling something down in his notebook before shuffling his case files together. \"I think I need some fresh air. Let's do a round at the car dealership.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Dexter\nB.

Howard, killed in his home office, and with barbed wire of all things. Admittedly, he wasn't an animal lover, but the fact the murderer was brazen enough to use something like that was unnerving.\n\nGetting out of his car, he approached the home of his latest suspect, Eric. A pet groomer by trade, who Howard had hired frequently to look after his pets. The peculiar thing about Eric was not only that he used barbed wire to fence the more adventurous pets in check, but that he always carried his work tools, barbed wire included, to his clients' homes. \n\nA neighbor had once mentioned how often he'd seen Eric hauling his grooming tools to his van, barbed wire coils included, and he frequently overheard the sound of water running from Eric's place, leading to reports of an unusually high water bill for Eric last month. The bill was discussed by the locals, and how this pet groomer used a lot of water in his duties wasn't lost on them.\n\nWinston knocked on the door, greeted by a man with sincere eyes and the faint smell of animal shampoo.\n\n“You're Eric, right?” said Winston.\n\n“That’s correct” the man replied with a friendly smile.\n\n\"And you groom pets, correct?\" Winston continued.\n\n\"That's right. I love animals. Even work with barbed wire to keep the more... adventurous ones in check. People in the neighborhood could tell you that. My next-door neighbor always sees me taking my work tools, including the wire, to my clients' homes and he hears the water running as well. You know, cause of bathing and grooming.\"\n\n“Hmm,...\" Winston hummed, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. \"You ever work at Howard's place?\"\n\n“Of course!\" Eric exclaimed quickly. \"Known him, his fiancee Gloria, and his pets for a while now. Have them on top of my customer list, along with a large number of other cat and dog owners.”\n\n“Gloria?” Winston probed.\n\nEric's face flushed, “Yes, I've known her for years, almost ten now. I visit her often for work, and...”\n\n\"Anything else about Gloria?\" Winston interrupted.\n\nEric paused for a moment before responding, “She’s special, Gloria. Kind to everything and everyone, she often showed me signs of warmth and kindness.\"\n\nAs Winston observed Eric, he noticed a notebook lying open on a nearby table. Flipping to the appointments section, he found a number of entries for cat and dog owners, confirming Eric's busy schedule. One page, however, caught his attention: a diary page with 'I love Gloria' written numerous times, speaking volumes about Eric's feelings for her.\n\n\"Thank you for your time, Eric,\" Winston finally said. As he headed towards the door, he turned and asked, \"Howard's office, fur on the barbed wire used?\"\n\nEric nodded. \"Yes, found it quite odd. Normally, I only groom pets in their homes.\"\n\nExiting the home, he made his way back to his car, a new collection of information swirling in his head. Winston had an uneasy feeling about this Eric. He made a mental note to have Eric’s diary and customer list with a number of cat and dog owners entered into evidence. There were a lot of dots to connect and they seemed to be dancing around in his head.\n\nThe blaring sirens came to a halt as Winston arrived at where the latest gruesome killing had taken place. Howard, a man who liked his quiet and often threw himself into work, found dead in his home office. According to initial reports, the murder weapon seemed to be a strand of barbed wire. Winston proceeded towards the crime scene, trying to keep his senses sharp to any clues he might find.\n\nPriscilla was a person of interest in the case. Tied to a string of crimes that included the use of barbed wire, she seemed more suspicious with every detail. Winston would be remiss if he didn't get all the facts about her lined up and ready. Priscilla, an ex-military personnel, stood out for her lack of an alibi during the time of murder. Winston made a note to conduct a thorough interrogation.\n\nWhile going over the diagrams and photos of the scene, Winston found that Howard's property was surrounded by barbed wire fences. An odd detail to his suburban house. Witnesses - the neighbors- reported seeing Priscilla's car on multiple occasions, and explicitly during the time of the murder, at the fenced property. A regular visitor, it seemed. Priscilla had no alibi, and knew the layout of the house well.\n\nHoward, always a reserved man, chose to spend lengthy hours alone in his home office. The numerous sightings of Priscilla at his house during these late work hours, and decisively at the time of murder, intrigued Winston. These were little crumbs, but they pointed Winston in a strong direction.\n\nWinston pulled Priscilla in for questioning; she was not an easy nut to crack. She had a history, pervasions into criminal activities that increased her confidence in her ability to avoid capture. Murmurings of previous killings involving barbed wire whirled around her, and each successful kill reportedly fed her sense of power and precision.\n\nWinston’s revelations grew more unnerving when he discovered that Howard, knowing too much, had threatened to turn her in to the authorities. A direct threat, a motive. Could she have killed Howard to protect her dark secrets? Unraveling Priscilla's role in this was going to be a daunting task that Winston had to muster the strength to undertake. Hidden somewhere amidst these scattered pieces of evidence was the truth, waiting to be pieced together.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Eric\nB.

The diary belonged to Kaylee, the victim, her handwriting tightened with anger in her most recent entry. She had discovered a wicked secret about her nanny, Penelope— a criminal past under the guise of a loving caregiver. Not only that, she was resolved in her decision to expose this to her parents and reveal Penelope's true identity.\n\nThe entry mentioned a clandestine meeting with Penelope, at an eerie, desolate place: an abandoned factory. Kaylee wrote, \"I must tell mom and dad about Penelope's past. They must know.\" Winston furrowed his brows, a nanny meeting her ward at such an odd place and knowing Kaylee, she wouldn't miss any other events or commitments. He had cross-checked Kaylee's schedule for that day, and there were no appointments or events that could contradict her plan to meet Penelope.\n\nThe diary held more surprises. Kaylee, innocent as she was, declared her intention of revealing Penelope's criminal past to her parents. No doubt Penelope knew. The thought of this exposure could overturn her life, costing her job and the respect she held in the community. A price too high to pay even for a remorseless criminal.\n\nHe glanced back at the diary. The meeting proved to be crucial. The factory was walking distance from Penelope's potter's bowled house, a home that served as the hub of the community's children. Additionally, Penelope was spotted leaving her house around the time of the meeting, walking with a sense of grim purpose. In her hand was an age-old pickaxe, which she wielded with an unsettling casualness.\n\nHis eyes flickered to the forensic report on his desk. The murder weapon was old and weathered, a mining pickaxe. The connection was too strong to dismiss- the same pickaxe Penelope was seen carrying before the murder, matched the brutal weapon used in the murder. \n\nWinston felt the sore pit of despair in his stomach. Penelope could suffer tremendous humiliation and the loss of everything dear to her if her past was revealed to Kaylee's parents. But the fact that she valued her job and social standing so severely made her the prime suspect. It was clear that she valued it more than anything, even more than upholding the law.\n\nStepping back from the pile of evidence, Winston inhaled a deep sigh. He wanted to make sense of this all, but it was not for him to corrupt the course of justice. He needed to let the facts speak for themselves, the same facts that were now undeniably pointing in one chilling direction.\n\nDetective Winston leaned back in his chair, sifting through the information before him. It was all a tangled mess--an ex-factory worker, Francis, whose wife had been found brutally murdered in the very factory he used to work at. \n         \nFrancis had occasionally talked about his days at the factory to his friends. Friends had mentioned about Francis reminiscing about his time at Old Mill factory. \"Francis, Bill, Daniel, Frank, Freddy...\" Winston muttered to himself, tracing the pattern with his finger.\n\nWinston spiraled in and out of the facts, unravelling the complexities layer by layer. The daughter. The hotel registries. The flipping between names. The Parent-Teacher meetings.\n\nDeciding to question Francis personally, Winston drove down to the local school where he found Francis engaged in a parent-teacher conference. Francis stood up on Winston's arrival, turned to the teacher next to him, Mary, and introduced himself as Freddy. He seemed genuinely ready to help in the investigation.\n           \nAt a local café, Jane walked up to Winston, recognizing him from the photo Francis had shown her. Francis had introduced himself to her as Frank. Jane was a recurring name in the twisting narrative of Francis.\n\nWinston briefed Francis about the facts surrounding Kaylee's murder while carefully watching his reactions. \"You used to work in the factory?\" he asked, already knowing the answer. \n\nFrancis nodded, \"Yes, worked there for years, before they shut it down.”\n\n\"And your daughter, she’s been seen with you frequently, stays with you during weekends?”\n\nFrancis shifted uncomfortably. \"Yes, that's...that's correct. She...well, she needs me.\"\n\nWinston remembered the therapist’s note about Francis's daughter attending regular therapy sessions. It was something to consider.\n\nThey moved to another question. \"Kaylee, was there an issue between your daughter and her?\"\n\nFrancis looked taken aback. \"What? No, not at all. They had... misunderstandings. Normal stuff.”\n\nWinston remembered a witness account of Kaylee yelling and acting aggressively towards the daughter. \"Are you often in town?\"\n\n\"Well, yes! I... yes, I mean... who isn't?”\n\nWinston decided not to light up the dichotomy of the hotel rooms and the different names. He wrapped up the meeting quietly.\n\nEarlier, as he had sifted through the hotel registries, Winston had found Francis's name on two dates. On August 5th, Francis had signed as \"Bill Norman\". A week later, on August 12th, a \"Daniel Smith\" had checked in. Both operational names of Francis. \n\nDuring his drive back to the station on the afternoon of August 12, the same unfortunate day Hampton found Kaylee's body in the factory, Winston replayed the meeting in his mind. The complexity of the situation was mind-boggling – a murder tied to an abandoned factory, a man with many names, a daughter in therapy, the translucent shield of parent-teacher involvement, and the ghost of past echoes in the disused factory.\n\nWinston parked his car and quietly noted down the date, the same one as the second hotel registry listing Francis - as Daniel Smith - and realized he was seen in town that very day.\n\nThe mystery deepened, and the facts were only getting murkier.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

There were five previous sightings of a man at the local zoo, groceries in hand, and each and every one of them connected to one individual - Glenn. He also found a receipt from the grocery store where Glenn works, it was a purchase for nails specifically for a nail gun.\n\nRemembering a recent eyewitness report of a man on the day of the murder, Winston recalled the description of a man being similar to Glenn, who was spotted carrying a bulky tool bag. \n\nWinston found Glenn at his place of work. Here, he observed Glenn greeting customers by different names, which sent his antenna up. This detail was also mentioned by Glenn's co-workers who noticed the different names on the rota and found it strange.\n\nGlenn, slightly bulky and distractedly stacking shelves, worked in the same grocery store. Curiously, he made a habit of filling out the work schedule with different names each week, a point his coworkers found as peculiar as Winston did.\n\nThe notes also mentioned that Glenn was a troubleshooter. Last winter, instead of hiring a professional, he fixed his leaky roof himself. The nails he bought earlier from the store were for this job, but no nail gun. He had to buy them from elsewhere because the store didn't sell those.\n\n\"Glenn?\" Winston called out, getting the clerk's attention. Glenn turned, his round face projecting innocence.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" He replied, offering Winston a smile.\n\n\"Winston Phillips, homicide,\" he introduced himself, flashing his badge briefly.\n\n\"Has there, uh, been a murder or something?\" Glenn asked, feigning obliviousness.\n\n\"You could say that,\" Winston confirmed, \"Could I ask where you were yesterday, Glenn?\"\n\nGlenn paused, scratching the back of his head before answering, \"Took my little girl to the zoo. We've got a membership there. We always watch the monkeys get fed, it's always at the same time.\"\n\nWinston's eyebrow lifted slightly. This matches the eyewitness reports placing Glenn at the zoo that day, and another reporting a bulky blue bag on his person.\n\n\"A tool bag to the zoo, Glenn?\" Winston raised the question.\n\nGlenn’s smile started to fade, \"I usually carry it around with me for work, it's got all my tools.\" He said, a flicker of unease in his eyes, \"In case I need them, you know.\"\n\nWinston found these elements forming a clear image, but he knew better than to impress suspicion where it wasn't explicitly warranted. He would need more. More conversations, more observations, and more unearthing of Glenn’s peculiar behaviours.\n\nDetective Winston brushed crumbs of his sandwich onto his pile of case files. His latest, involving a man named Walter, was proving rather intriguing. Walter had been involved in some questionable business deals... to put it mildly. An interesting detail in all this was that Walter's murder had occurred during an excursion to the local zoo.\n\nWinston squinted his eyes at the witness statement in front of him, given by the key character in this tragedy, a man named Dennis. Dennis had been living with Walter as a foster son and had been a reluctant observer to Walter's illegal doings. He'd had a fear of Walter that was believable in its intensity. His words stuttered and shook on the page as he described how Walter threatened him with dire consequences.\n\nWinston grabbed his keys and headed out to meet with Dennis at his worksite, the lad worked construction, a fact confirmed by Winston's preliminary check.\n\nApproaching the site, Winston saw Dennis working with a nail gun, a tool that looked like a second skin on the young man's hand. Winston could see the professional ease of Dennis wielding the heavy tool and hit his targets with precision.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Dennis,\" Winston greeted him. The young man paused and turned towards him, his face a flicker of honest surprise. \"Oh, hi, detective\", he replied.\n\n\"Dennis\", Winston started, \"Can you confirm that Walter had invited you to the zoo that day?\"\n\nA chill ran over Dennis's face as he replied, \"Yes, that's correct.\"\n\n\"Do you often go to the zoo?\"\n\nThe young man got a far-off look in his eyes, \"Yeah, we used to go often. Bonding.. they call it..\"\n\n\"I see,\" Winston responded,\" and about your purchase at the hardware store the day before the visit...\"\n\nDennis looked confused, \"Yes, I frequently buy supplies for work. That day, it was a box of nails for my nail gun.\"\n\nLooking around the site party in admiration and part nostalgia, Winston asked, \"Work keeps you busy?\"\n\nGrinning at that, Dennis said, \"It does, detective, but I had a free day... the day Walter died.\" His voice caught on the last sentence.\n\n\"Alright Dennis, thank you for your time\", Winston said, turning on his heel to leave.\n\nThe zoo itself was Winston's next stop. He noted it was unusually quiet and several areas were deserted. Perfect chance for a murder, he mused, not that Dennis did it. There's plenty yet to uncover.\n\nAs he was exiting, Winston's phone buzzed. His latest query results for Dennis had arrived. The lad did visit a hardware store the day before Walter's murder. And the purchase details matched Dennis's account of buying nails for his nail gun.\n\nWinston buckled up in his car and sighed heavily. There was a sense of fear creeping up his spine, not his own but one that belonged to a young construction worker. A troubled foster son. A possible suspect. A probable witness.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Glenn\nB.

His latest case involved a peculiar victim, Murray, who was fond of working alone during the twilight hours in his office. The cause of death was a strange one - bleach ingestion.\n\nAfter nightfall, Winston's steps echoed in the office building as he sought out his next interviewee. Emerging from a nondescript door labelled \"Rehearsal\", the sound of dancers practicing halted abruptly. Winston found himself amongst Gloria's dominion.\n\n“Ms. Gloria, could I have a moment of your time?” Winston asked, interrupting her choreography.\n\n“Every second counts, Detective... My rehearsals always seem to go overtime,” Gloria replied, her voice resounding in the empty practice space. Around her, a set of costumes lined the room, each one carefully cleaned. Gloria had a reputation for maintaining the utmost hygiene in her costumes.\n\nWinston remarked, \"It's unusual to see a dance studio without a security camera. The owners not concerned about break-ins?\"\n\n“Well, they leave matters of security to us... How could I help, Detective?” Gloria pushed aside her rehearsal props, which included a curious bleach bottle among her personal belongings, providing Winston a chair in her living quarters in the rehearsal building. Given her late-night practices, she had repurposed a portion of the room to serve as her personal living space.\n\nIn her living space, an enormous filing cabinet stood imposingly, filled to the brim with newspaper clippings. Winston could tell she was fond of keeping up with recent events. Also, the sheer size of the cabinet suggested it might be Gloria’s version of a living room.\n\n\"I see you have a large filing cabinet in your living quarters, Gloria. That’s quite full of newspaper clippings.\" Winston commented, pointing to the open drawer.\n\n\"Ah, Detective, I like to stay informed... I make it a point to read through every obituary in the early morning. A peculiar morning ritual, I know...,\" Gloria replied, confirming her subscription to every local newspaper.\n\n\"You certainly seem to research chemicals, too,” Winston observed, his eye having been caught by the organized array of chemical notations and formulas that were punctuating her choreography notes.\n\n“Absolutely,\" Gloria animatedly replied, quickly adding, \"For example, bleach is highly toxic when ingested. It's commonly used for maintaining the hygiene of the costumes.” \n\nWinston stood up to leave, thanking Gloria for her time. \"So do you use this office year-round?\"\n\n\"No, only for late-night practices. And I believe Murray also preferred afterhours here,\" Gloria offered.\n\n\"Thank you for your time, Gloria.\"\n\n“Detective, are you sure you have all the information you need?” Gloria asked, escorting him to the door.\n\n“I believe I do. I’ll be in touch,” Winston nodded, stepping back out into the dim-lit alley.\n\nWinston sat in the hard plastic chair outside the office of Chris, the coach of the office's intramural sports leagues. The location seemed like an unlikely place for a murder, but Murray had indeed collapsed dead in his office several buildings over from ingesting a poisonous substance, a terrible surprise considering Murray typically avoided the recreational facilities of the office.\n\nThe door cracked open, and Chris invited Winston in. The office was small but spacious enough to hold stacks of sports equipment, training manuals and a variety of cleaning agents that he included as part of his coaching supplies - everything from towels to a close-to-empty bottle of bleach. Winston looked at the bleach and couldn't help but recollect the unfortunate death of Murray, caused by poison.\n\nThe two men sat on either side of the desk cluttered with paper-work and game plans. \"Murray?\" Chris grimaced as he spoke out the name of the victim, a surprising response from an individual not typically associated with the inter-office politics.\n\nWinston cleared his throat, initiating the conversation. \"When did you last see him, Chris?\"\n\n\"Funny you'd ask. Just yesterday, in his office. Over a decision in the final game, you know.\" Chris's voice grew noticeably cooler.\n\nWinston recalled the chatter at the water-cooler about last week's defeat in the championship game. The stakes high, the loss did not sit well with the team or Chris, as Winston observed from the stern look on the coach's face. There had been confrontations, Winston had heard, and the echo of an argument -- Murray's decision suddenly seemed to favor the rival team.\n\n\"Everyone was... upset,\" Winston found the right word, \"about the decision. The last match was important, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"More than just a game, wasn’t it Detective?\" Chris's evasive reply wrapped around his rising passion for the job. The loss was more personal, Winston noted.\n\n“You’re here during the day, right?” Winston asked, looking for a confirmation.\n\n“Yes, sir. My coaching matches the office's regular hours,” Chris replied.\n\n“Your duties - it must be more than throwing balls and yelling at players.” It was Winston’s turn to lighten up the mood.\n\n“Funny, Detect. I’m responsible for equipment and supply maintenance. And trust me, yanking up fifty-pound weights and keeping the towels and bottles clean and safe - it ain’t no walk in the park.”\n\n\"Safe? Like using cleaning products perhaps,” Winston stated, looking right at the supplies Chris kept in his office.\n\n“Sure. You never know when something spills. Have to keep it all clean and safe,\" Chris echoed.\n\nWinston recollected an incident from the past where a young office athlete under Chris's coaching had ingested cleaning fluid, mistaken for water no less, and had an unpleasantly grim hospital visit. The echo of that incident reverberating in the present, with Murray's poisoning almost felt like a devious pattern, thought Winston.\n\n\"Wouldn’t want another upset tummies, would we?” Winston rose from the chair, leaving Chris with a thoughtful stare.\n\n\"No, we wouldn’t, Detective.\"\n\nWinston left the office, running over the conversation in his mind as he remembered the empty bottle of bleach in the corner of Chris’s office. There was certainly more to uncover; the echoes of past and present were too loud to ignore.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Chris\nB.

He stumbled upon a chalet managed by a woman named Yolanda. \n\nAs Winston hit the road, his thoughts steered towards the information he had gathered. Mackenzie had been part of Yolanda's tour group before his murder occurred on the eve of their scheduled contact. She managed her tours in the countryside meticulously. The control she had over the schedule of the outings, including the fateful one in which Mackenzie was murdered, intrigued Winston.\n\nHis mind drifted back to the victim. Mackenzie had found out about Yolanda's past, a string of cheating instances involving her tour clients, and the woman bore a lengthy criminal record as a result. In fact, Mackenzie was under the impression that she had conned him out of money as well, and he had evidence to prove so. Hence, the threats of exposure he made just before the tour, threatening to bring down Yolanda's whole charade if she didn't pay him off.\n\nWinston yanked the steering wheel to his jeep, steering it down a rural path as he followed the coordinates to the chalet. The area was primarily farmland, a quiet countryside where the chalet sat nestled. Yolanda worked here, a guide amidst the rustic charm and tranquility, where such unfortunate events as Mackenzie's murder took place.\n\nApproaching the chalet, Winston observed the tools strewn around the land nearby, tools that weren't entirely uncommon to such rural regions. That included the sickle, commonly used for tough manual jobs done by locals during tours.\n\n\"Detective, may I help you?\" A woman called, her hands resting on her hips as she presented a robust picture of strength and resilience. Her firm tone and her hardened features attested to her familiarity with tough manual labor. Yolanda was her name, the tour guide of the chalet where Mackenzie was last seen alive during her tour.\n\n\"Yes, Yolanda, right?\" Winston treaded carefully, pacing his sentences. \n\n\"That's correct, detective,\" She replied, her gaze steady, \"This chalet, it's a part of the tour destinations I manage.\"\n\n\"You work around these areas quite a bit then?\" Winston probed, his eyes scanning the area.\n\n\"That's right,\" Yolanda said, her hands sweeping the landscape, \"My tours consist of these rural areas, I find the countryside soothing.\"\n\n\"So I heard,\" Winston nodded, tucking away a piece of information about the murder happening during one of these tours, as he turned to retreat.\n\nWinston was a man of the city, yet he found himself drawn to the tranquility of the chalet nestled in the snowy mountains. This tranquility was disrupted by the gruesome murder of the chalet's owner, Mackenzie. No heirs, all that was left was a cold case just like the winter’s harsh weather.\n\nHis main puzzle piece at the moment was Julius. As far as Winston had gathered, Julius was frequently seen around the chalet courting religious duties. A Rabbi with admiration for Mackenzie's business, he pondered as he moved through the chalet.\n\nBrushing off the snow from his overcoat, he walked down to Julius's residence. He found his neighbour out, tending to his plants, who readily shared with Winston his observations about the Rabbi. “Late nights, buddy, that's when you hear it! Car cleaning noises. Almost ritualistic, you might say.” He gestured with a chuckle towards Julius's car that appeared glistening clean even in the morning frost.\n\nKeeping his poker face intact, Winston thanked him and moved on to Julius's place to gain some firsthand perspective. Julius, next of kin, was willing to engage with Winston. \"I was at the chalet both times,” he conceded, “In the morning to pay my respects, in the evening for my religious duties. I express no remorse for my actions.”\n\nSeeing the need to switch the conversation to less stringent matters, Winston asked about Julius's frequent trips to the auto-parts store. The rabbi, a bit taken aback, chuckled and affirmed, “Ah, you mean the cleaning supplies? Yes, I don't like to keep my car dirty. A friend of mine, a car enthusiast, once saw me buying in bulk and joked I was preparing for apocalypse.”\n\nJulius voiced no regret for his admiration towards Mackenzie's business. His eyes filled with fond memories, he added, “Our community often frowned upon his lack of religious beliefs, but I admired him. His open-mindedness is to be celebrated. Even in mourning I believe it’s important to remember the good.”\n\nWinston returned to the cold chalet. Julius was indeed a complex character, but he was on a mission to uncover the truth. What did Julius do the night of the murder? With Mackenzie’s time of death set in the evening, he wondered what the events were that unfolded in this chalet. The detective in him would not rest until all the pieces of the puzzle come together. Murders, after all, can happen where you least expect them to.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Julius\nB.

The diary, full of Kaylee's secrets, revealed her confrontation with Penelope. She had discovered Penelope’s criminal past and had explicitly written that she was going to expose this to the parents of the children for whom Penelope worked as a nanny. \n\nThrough the diary, he also knew about Kaylee’s planned meeting with Penelope at the old, abandoned factory; there were no other events slated for that day.\n\nWith a sense of urgency, Detective Winston decided it was time to visit Penelope. As he arrived at her elegant residence, he marked its close proximity to the abandoned factory. Their locations made it plausible for Penelope to have walked from her home at about the time estimated for the murder. A neighbor had even mentioned seeing Penelope leave her house around that time, which made him more suspicious.\n\n\"Hello, Penelope,\" Detective Winston extended a curt greeting to the lady of the house. \n\n\"Hello Detective,\" she offered a polite smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. \n\n\"As you know, we are here regarding Kaylee's murder,” said Winston in a low voice. \n\nPenelope’s face turned pale, “Oh yes, such a tragedy… Kaylee was such a sweet girl…”\n\nWinston continued his questioning, “It seems like Kaylee threatened to expose your criminal past, Penelope. According to her diary, she found out and was on the brink of telling the parents of the children under your care. Did you know about that?”\n\nPenelope failed to hide the fear flashing in her eyes. Winston took in the opulent house and her genteel demeanor, recognizing the value she placed on her reputation and job as a nanny. The exposure of her criminal past could result in severe humiliation and she could lose her standing in the community.\n\nPenelope's neighbor, who'd earlier mentioned seeing her leave the house, had also seen her with a pickaxe a few times recently around the same location. Winston found it hard to dismiss the coincidence when considering the murder weapon was an old mining pickaxe that matched the one Penelope was seen with.\n\nExiting the house, Winston mused about the connections he’d established. He'd confirmed that Penelope was seen leaving her house around the same time as the murder. The weapon matched the pickaxe she'd been seen with. And Kaylee’s diary affirmed her plan to expose Penelope—threats that must have seemed more than idle to a woman who placed such a high value on her reputation and job.\n\nAs afternoon slipped into dusk, Winston felt that he had advanced a few steps closer to solving the grim puzzle.\n\nDetective Winston was thumbing through a stack of reports. The murder of Kaylee had him running in a million different directions. A key detail caught his eye - Kaylee loved to bully, specifically Francis's daughter, probably knew the girl was experiencing depression and anxiety, and took pleasure out of making life miserable for the kid. \n\nReviewing the testimonies of various key persons, he found one by Jane who met a man named Frank, whose physical and behavioral description matched that of Francis. Winston raised an eyebrow, even more, when he found Mary's account. Though her statement identified the man as 'Freddy', all facts pointed directly to Francis. Winston decided to pay a visit to Francis, Kaylee's husband. \n\nAs the detective rolled up to the family home, out walked a middle-aged man, abruptly ending a phone conversation to greet him. \n\n\"Ah, you must be Freddy,\" Winston queried casually.\n\n\"Oh, no, you got it wrong. My name's Francis,\" the man corrected with an uneasy grin. \n\nThe conversation shifted towards the troublesome relationship between Kaylee and Francis's daughter. Francis admitted he had recently caught Kaylee in one of her cruel tirades towards his daughter. This revelation seemed to disarm the husband, who agreed to arrange a confrontation with Kaylee.\n\nCareful investigation further revealed that the chosen rendezvous point was an abandoned factory. An eccentric choice, but not entirely unreasonable to Francis, who was knowledgeable about the timings when the factory would be devoid of any workers. An abandoned factory offered privacy, secrecy that could not be achieved in a public space. Francis then revealed that he had persuaded Kaylee to meet him there.\n\nLooking at all the evidence, it's apparent Kaylee trusted her husband unquestioningly. This made Winston wonder whether she ever questioned Francis about the odd meeting place or if Francis's trust overpowered her doubts. \n\nBefore leaving, however, Winston brought up something else that had been bothering him. In his possession were two hotel registries with peculiar entries: one signed as 'Daniel Smith' on August 12th, the other as 'Bill Norman' on August 5th. Events that were extremely out of the ordinary for the residents of the Grand Star Hotel.\n\n\"You ever been to the Grand Star Hotel?\" Winston asked Francis.\n\nFrancis looked puzzled, \"No, can't say I have.\"\n\n\"But you signed the registries as 'Daniel Smith' on August 12th and 'Bill Norman' on August 5th. I’ve checked and the physical descriptions match yours perfectly. Do you have anything to say?\"\n\nFrancis appeared even more confused as the detective got into his car leaving him seemingly bewildered by the line of questioning. However, Winston knew there was much more to investigate. In any case, he now had fresh leads to follow.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Penelope\nB.

Her thread of criminal activities had caught her in quite a controversy at the vineyard. It was impossible to miss her confrontational personality - as though she was daring someone to stop her when stealing exquisite, rare, and expensive wines for her personal collection.\n\nWinston couldn't help but contemplate the strange occurrence in Bella's personal life. Young men entered her domain and exited as quickly as they had appeared, never to be seen again. With every month, a new face would hover around Bella and by the end of the month, he would be gone, replaced by someone new. Each of Bella's ex-boyfriends had immediately relocated after their breakups, disappearing from the local scene completely. It was a peculiar pattern; the complete absence of these ex-boyfriends aroused his curiosity.\n\nWhat intrigued him further was Bella's striking composure amidst the turmoil of her fluctuating relationships. As impassive as the vineyard's stoic trellises after a heavy rainfall, she remained unfazed.\n\nWinston glanced at his notes again. She had been working in the vineyard on that fated day. Scratched and scuffed, the details of her encounter with Terry taunted him. They were seen arguing earlier in the day in the very vicinity where Terry's lifeless body was discovered later on.\n\nTerry confronted Bella about her escalating thefts. He even threatened to report her consistent wrongdoings to the management. Winston could still hear Terry's exasperated voice echoing through his memory, \"I won't ignore your actions anymore, Bella.\"\n\nHe knew he had to remain as neutral as possible. He had an interview with Bella later that day. Still, he was haunted by the fact that Bella was spotted close to the murder shed minutes before Terry's untimely death. The evidence seemed to be tediously compiling against her, even if he couldn’t make a judgment yet.\n\nAs he left the confines of his office, he carried with him a myriad of unanswered questions stirred by Bella's questionable activities and peculiar patterns. He couldn't share his suspicions but had to continue peeling the layers off Bella's shrouded lifestyle to find the truth about Terry's unfortunate demise.\n\nWinston pulled up to the vineyard. Terry had been found stabbed there with a shiv, a simple tool turned deadly in wrong hands. As a detective, he had seen a variety of murder weapons, but this was unusual for the calm and serene vineyard setting. A vineyard, that was owned by the very victim, Terry. \n\nHe could see Jose, hard at work on a new structure. Not surprising, as the police records stated that Jose was a construction worker assigned to the vineyard project.\n\nIn a staccato rhythm, Winston released a volley of questions towards Jose. \"You were working here when Terry was murdered?\" Jose merely nodded, the mid-day heat not offering much conversation. \n\nThe fact that Terry was also on the vineyard premises when his murder occurred wasn't sheer coincidence. He owned this place and had the habit of visiting regularly and checking on things. Like a suspicious owner, which might have driven him to suspect theft and falsify work hours.\n\nWinston decided to indulge in those eve`s dropping senses and questioned Jose discreetly, \"I heard Terry was saying something about someone stealing tools from the site. Also, there was a rumor that Terry had found out about some false time-sheets. What do you say, Jose?\" \n\n\"Well, sir, I won't lie,\" Jose said, after a moment of elaborated silence, \"He did accuse me of theft and false time-sheet matters. It's true, Terry had discovered I was falsifying my work hours. But, I wouldn’t dare do such things.\" The accusation was serious enough that Terry had even threatened to dismiss Jose. \n\nAnd with dismissal came a perilous reality for Jose - complete shortfall of income. \"Call it fate Sir, but I was really worried as this was solely my source of income.\"\n\nThis was common knowledge among construction workers that their job gave them access to a variety of tools, possibly even those that potentially could be turned into a simple weapon like a shiv. Many of the tools that could be found on a given construction site had sharp edges and could easily be fashioned into a homemade knife.\n\n\"Winston, the construction work often involves building and crafting things from a number of materials. It's just that, it's a hands-on job. But it doesn’t mean we all are knave, sir.\" \n\nSeeing the sun dipping into its sunset, Winston thanked Jose for his time before getting back into his car. As he mused over the case he was dealing with, he realized it was anything but simple... just as dark and complex as the ripe grapes in Terry's vineyard.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Staying in shape was crucial for catching suspects on foot. But even he was taken aback by the sheer enormity of Van, the local bodybuilder. The rumor in town was that Van had been recently struggling with large debts. The man stood near six and a half feet tall, his enormous physique a testament to the countless hours he obviously spent in the gym, instead of accepting invitations to the various social events.\n\nWinston felt like David meeting Goliath as he marched towards the muscular man. \"Hey, Van?\" He called out, to which the man gave a mere grunt in response. Several people in the gym watched as the scene unfolded; in this place, Van was a sort of brawny legend who preferred the solitude of his weights over any socializing. Just the other day, a friend had asked him about his dating life with Xenia, but he brushed it aside.\n\n\"Detective Winston. I'd like to ask you a few questions,\" Winston showed his badge. \"About Xenia.\"\n\nVan was taken-aback by the upfrontness of the question. He grunted again, this time out of exasperation. \n\n\"Detective, didn't expect that one coming,\" he said finally lifting his head to acknowledge the detective. \"Alright, shoot.\"\n\nWinston pulled out his notebook and an envelope from the local hardware store, \"Did you take a construction safety course recently?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I used to build furniture for fun,\" Van answered in between grunts, continuing his reps, \"Safety first and all that.\"\n\n\"And did this fascination with construction lead you to buying a nail gun?\" Winston asked, pulling a purchase receipt out of the envelope. \"The receipt I found in your wallet indicates you bought the same model used for Xenia's murder.\"\n\nVan's expression changed for the first time, a small frown appeared on his face. \"Yeah, why?\"\n\n\"There's no easy way to say this...\" Winston gathered his words, \"but Xenia, she's been killed. She was shot with a nail gun. The same type that you recently bought.\"\n\nVan's barbell dropped onto the floor with a loud crash. \"Xenia is dead?\" he asked in disbelief. \n\nWinston confirmed with a solemn nod. \"She recently updated her life insurance policy, which you had changed to make you the sole beneficiary.\" He added, \"The payout would be considerable, enough to solve your debt troubles.\"\n\nDisbelief crossed Van's face. He ruffled his hair nervously before swiftly changing the topic, \"I hit a new record today. 350 pounds.\"\n\nA change in topic wasn't unusual when dealing with shock, to Winston's experience. He however, decided to dive ahead, \"Xenia's will and her life insurance policy, which amounts to a hefty sum of $1.2 million, put a lot of money in your name, Van.\"\n\nVan swiftly stood from his weight bench, a scowl deepening on his face. \"Are you implying I killed her for her money?\"\n\n\"Just figuring out what happened,\" Winston calmly replied.\n\n\"Well, if that's all detective, you'll have to excuse me. I've got to... digest this information,\" Van said, storming out of the gym.\n\nWinston watched him leave, noting that for someone who'd just lost someone close, Van seemed to recover pretty fast. He jotted down a final note: 'Van wasn't much for social events, but he certainly had his priorities set on the gym.' With a sigh, he reached for his phone... There was more investigation to be done.\n\nWinston pulled into his usual parking spot at the bustling shopping mall, where Xenia had been found dead. Taking a moment, he observed the familiar sight of storied storefronts and the commotion of shoppers going about their business – everything seemed normal, but its surface was marred by the undercurrent of a sinister act.\n\nStepping out, Winston headed towards the scene of the crime, where Xenia's body was discovered amongst the kaleidoscope of mall storefronts.\n\nSuddenly, his phone rang. Winston answered it briskly, \"This is Winston.\"\n\n\"This is Janet from Dispatch. Got a preliminary report back. The murder weapon was a nail gun... reportedly missing from a nearby construction site.\" Janet informed him.\n\n\"Interesting... thanks, Janet.\" Winston said before hanging up.\n\nOne person in mind, Winston mused, Wilfred, a city lawyer handling the lawsuit against the mall’s recent haphazardly built expansion – he was known to have some construction experience with a reported affinity for nail guns. Funny little detail that used to be an innocence quirk of Wilfred’s. After all, the nail gun was reported missing from Wilfred’s construction project.\n\nWinston walked into the site of construction, observing the works and chaos of a massive project, evidence of Wilfred’s connection with the site.\n\nLater, Winston decided to pay Wilfred a visit. Finding him in his office, Winston pulled out a photo from his coat pocket and tossed it on Wilfred's desk – a grainy shot from a CCTV footage showing Wilfred in the mall at the time of Xenia’s death.\n\nWilfred squinted at the image, evidently uncomfortable. With his back turned to Winston, working late at his desk, he seemed just as any other lawyer.\n\n\"Wilfred, doing some moonlighting at the mall, were you?\" Winston asked, his tone casual yet probing.\n\n\"I... I do my evening walks there sometimes,\" Wilfred replied.\n\nWinston pulled out another document from his coat pocket, \"You may want to come down to the station, Wilfred. Answer a few questions about your whereabouts last night.\"\n\nWilfred hesitated, then nodded, \"I understand.\"\n\nAs Winston left Wilfred’s office, he couldn't help wonder about Xenia’s last desperate plead to Wilfred, about specifically taking down the corrupt politician down, waving her damning evidence. As allegations of political scandal were beginning to surround Wilfred, Xenia had somehow been caught in the crossfire. She paid a high price, killed during a time when Wilfred had no alibi, when his whereabouts were unknown to all.\n\nThe lawyer’s life slowly gave away a shade that Winston hadn't exactly expected. Packed with political scandal, hurried construction projects, controversial missing nail guns, and unaccounted for times, life was never meant to be this complicated.\n\nWinston closed the car door behind him, a deep sigh escaping him. The case had just begun.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Van\nB.

Murder always had a way of turning the beauty of the world eerie, each flutter of nature appearing as if it was whispering the secrets of the dark act committed here.\n\nLeroy, it seemed, had met his end here, impaled by a sai. It was a martial arts weapon distinct in its deadly simplicity, known all too well by the martial arts community. \n\nWinston mulled over the circumstances surrounding Leroy's death. Leroy had gotten married to Clayton's ex-wife shortly after they had filed for divorce.\n\nLeaving the scene, Winston drove the short distance to the local dojo owned and run by a man by the name of Clayton. Clayton was an ex-husband to the recent bride of Leroy, and an avid martial arts instructor. According to whispers among the locals, he seemed to be a man still inherently in love with his ex-wife, a flame that lulled even after their love had supposedly extinguished.\n\nOn driving to the dojo, nostalgic flashes of visits to the local bar sprung forth in Winston's mind. Memories of how locals had on multiple occasions, narrated tales of Clayton exploring the swamp alone and of how he also ran survival tours there. On the day of the murder, many people at the local bar saw Clayton getting into his car alone, painting a picture of his solitary routine.\n\nUpon arriving, he found Clayton, kneeling before an illustrious collection of martial arts weaponry, that included a sai, the same weapon used in the murder of Leroy.  \n\n\"So, you collect these?\" Winston asked, nodding at the weapons.\n\n\"It's part of the job,\" Clayton responded as he carefully set down the sai, \"having a wide knowledge of martial arts weaponry. But yes, I have developed a personal collection.\" \n\nWinston ventured further, \"I heard you run survival tours in the swamp.\"\n\nClayton chuckled. \"Oh yes. I love exploring the swamp. It's like it's a part of me. Each corner, each nook, I know all of them like the back of my hand.”\n\nWinston then mentioned Clayton's recent loss. \"Your ex got married to Leroy shortly after your divorce... Must've been a real punch in the gut,\" he said, gauging Clayton’s reaction. \n\nClayton grimaced then muttered, \"Well, yeah, of course. Can't deny it stung a bit.\"  \n\"But you'd want her back--\"\n\nWithout waiting for Winston to finish, Clayton interjected. \"Yes, I would. But she made it clear she doesn't want a reconciliation as long as Leroy is around.\" \n\nAs Winston left the dojo, he began to storyboard the potential narrative. A man still in love with his ex-wife who wed another man right after their divorce, seen alone on the day of her new husband’s murder, with a confession that the ex-wife did not want to reconcile as long as Leroy was alive. He had a lot to ponder.\n\nDetective Winston strode into the lobby of the martial arts gym, taking in the sights of many people practicing their moves, some more graceful than others. His attention quickly moved to a woman near the back of the room, demonstrating a jarring, yet elegant, technique to her student with a sai. Recognizing her from a picture at his precinct, Winston confirmed it was Madelyn.\n\nHe recalled Leroy’s fitness schedule, and his plans to switch personal trainers, leaving Madelyn for her biggest competitor. Friends had mentioned conversations Leroy had with Madelyn's rival. Winston also knew from his sources, she had been in the vicinity when Leroy was on the phone discussing the change.\n\nMadelyn had a reputation of changing her hair practically every week. She seemed to enjoy the variety and surprise. A confirmed fact when Winston had visited her residential premises discovering several multi-colored wigs.\n\nNot wasting any time, Winston approached Madelyn after her demonstration. Madelyn agreed to go to the local coffee shop for a friendly chat. After a sputtered start, Winston was able to get Madelyn talking about her martial arts training, including the sai technique she used in her demonstration. A technique he knew was the cause of Leroy’s death.\n\nHer unique weapon choice hadn't really surprised him. Given the dimension of martial arts Madelyn specialized in, he suspected the sai came from her collection. A trip to the local martial arts store had led him to a store owner who confirmed her recent purchase of a pair. As well, the owner remembered seeing Madelyn practicing with her new acquisition at a local gym.\n\nEventually, Winston brought up the subject of passports. He'd found an interesting assortment of passports in various names inside a filing cabinet at Madelyn's house. He recalled her flustered behavior earlier at the post office where she'd been spotted getting passport photos taken. She struggled to explain, her face blanching at what he might uncover.\n\nThe conversation ended on a note of betrayal, with Madelyn softly admitting her inner circle betrayals. Winston gathered the facts in his mind, of hair wigs, martial arts and betrayal. Whisking the rest of his untouched coffee, he left Madelyn at the table, lost in her own world of memories.\n\nYet Winston had a murder inquiry to solve and no amount of color-changing wigs or phony passports could disguise that fact. He walked away with a nod, thinking of the next steps he would take before approaching Madelyn again. Irrespective of what she chose to conceal, he believed in the truth unveiling itself, the truth of a victim named Leroy.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Clayton\nB.

He was drawn particularly by an old letter from Santiago, unequivocally stating his refusal to sell his mountain territory to anyone, especially Orville, regardless of the offered price. Santiago's deep love for his expansive land wouldn't allow it to change hands. His particular appreciation for nature was unmatched, even a confirmed legend of hidden treasure located somewhere in its vast landscapes did not sway him to sell. That hidden treasure surely was captivating, but it didn't stop others from having an interest in the land though...\n\nOne name kept appearing on Winston’s radar - Orville. An orthodontist by trade, he had a strangely intense interest in Santiago’s mountain territory with its hidden treasure. His colleagues at the office had even noticed some tools missing after he'd left for the weekend.\n\nHanging on the wall of his clinic were several pistols on display, including one that remarkably resembled the murder weapon. Winston also recalled Orville had made a new purchase recently – a pistol similar to the one used for the murder happened a week before Santiago's untimely end.\n\nAs he further delved into Santiago's records, Winston found rejected letters from Orville proposing to buy the property, revealing that Santiago was indeed aware of Orville's avid interest in his property.\n\nTurning his attention to Orville, Winston saw a deeply ambitious man. Yes, he maintained a secretive nature. Moreover, he’d been observed planning a camping trip over the weekend, although he always answered in vagaries about the nature of his trips when questioned by coworkers.\n\nA chime from his laptop interrupted Winston's thoughts. Rolling over to the screen, he answered a video call from a woman at Orville's office.\n\n\"Detective Winston,\" she began nervously, \"We've just found out something. Orville... he had planned a camping trip this weekend. We tried asking him about it, but he... he just wouldn't respond.\"\n\nWinston thanked her and dropped the call. As he turned back to the case notes, his mind was alight with thoughts. All he needed now was to speak with Orville himself. The next step was clear; it was time to pay a visit to the local orthodontist.\n\nWinston let out a heavy sigh as he examined the details of the case file spread out across his desk. Santiago, a key figure in the world of astrophysics, and much to his dislike, the sole decider of the prestigious astrophysicist award, was brutally murdered in the isolation of his mountain cabin, a remote retreat far beyond the interference of city lights. The cold echo of an unseen pistol carried away by the wind - a chilling phantom of the night.\n\nWith a clear picture of the crime scene in his mind, Winston decided to pay the astrophysicist Troy a visit. From what he gathered from his notes, Troy wasn't just any astrophysicist. He was a man shaped by discipline and challenge, forged in the unforgiving inferno of military service where he honed his firearm expertise. His precision wasn’t confined to science alone. He frequently reminisced about his days at service.\n\nArriving at Troy's house in the city, he found the astrophysicist on his porch, quietly nursing a bottle of beer, eyes fixed on the sky. \"You have a familiarity with guns, from your service days, right Troy?” Winston asked.\n\nTroy glanced toward Winston, a strange melancholy in his eyes. \"Firearm expertise was a specialty of mine once. It’s not something you forget... And let's not forget the ammunition needed which is also as important as the gun itself,\" His words hung heavily in the quiet night air.\n\nWinston gave a nod of understanding, shifting the conversation. “There was quite a kerfuffle over the award this year. Isn't it true that Santiago chose another candidate over you?”\n\nAt the mention of the award, Troy’s face hardened momentarily. \"Santiago, that snake. He uses my research, puts his name on my work, conveniently wins and even had the audacity to choose someone else over me.\" Troy’s voice held an all too familiar bitterness.\n\nWinston filed the comment away mentally, moving on to the gun purchase caught on the store’s surveillance. “Someone told me they saw you in the gun shop recently. Buying a new piece and loading on ammunition?”\n\nTroy locked eyes with Winston, neither flinching nor stammering as he confirmed, \"Yeah. I bought a pistol and got ammunition too. Nothing wrong in owning a gun and enough shells, especially when you know your way around them.\"\n\nSantiago's murder, Troy’s frustration and the gun purchase were all there. Winston allowed himself that familiar pinch of doubt as he left Troy's house. But he also knew that the isolated cabin’s single point of access has been under camera surveillance that fateful night. Its cold, unblinking eye caught every movement, every shadow. It offered no escape.\n\nThe timestamp on the camera feed matched the coroner's estimated time of death, leaving no room for error. But again, Santiago's name on Troy's publication, the glaring imbalance of power within the research award committee... it all lingered at the back of his mind. The pieces were there, but the puzzle wasn’t yet solved.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Orville\nB.

This was Van, Xenia's accountant, the man whose name is repeated within the pages of her recent will and life insurance policy changes, as sole beneficiary. \n\nVan possessed an imposing frame, earned through countless hours in the gym, evidenced not only by his physique, but by the common knowledge that when not immersed in numerical acrobatics for his clients, Van was often pumping iron. His impressive devotion to physical fitness was a topic of conversation in many social circles, where he was frequently invited but always declined the invitations. Those who knew him joked about how he replaces the traditional 'work hard, play hard' with 'work hard, lift harder'.\n\nA fresh stream of tobacco smoke curled lazily from Winston's cigarette, the detective registered Van's behavior, quiet with a touch of aloofness. It piqued Winston's interest when the burly accountant was asked by a mutual acquaintance about his dating life, he deftly switched the topic to his recent smash of weightlifting records.\n\nVan, it seemed, preferred to shy away from social gatherings and personal inquiries, focusing on his private world of numbers and weights. It was quite a departure from his previous interest in furniture crafting where he had even enrolled in the course on construction safety to hone his hands-on skills.\n\nAll these were pieces of a puzzle Winston was trying to solve, yet there were occasional pieces that invariably stood out, like the receipt of a nail gun purchase Winston had found in Van's wallet and then confirmed by mail from the hardware store.\n\nThe same model nail gun, as the one used to end Xenia's life. A curious coincidence. And with Xenia's vast insurance payout at play and Van's trigger-happy finger on her life insurance policy alteration, Winston prodded further into Van's possible involvement. \n\nHe couldn't ignore the specter of Van's towering debts that strayed too close, too often into the spotlight, even this brief encounter.\n\nWinston had come a long way in his career, and he realized he had barely scratched the surface with this accountant. A man who lived in numbers, and died by them.\n\nWinston had spent all day at the busy crime scene at the local shopping mall – a gruesome scene with the victim Xenia, killed by a nail gun. Winston was hunting for leads to a suspect rumored to be a local lawyer turned aspiring politician. The bell on the mall entry chimed and in he walked, Wilfred. \n\n“Howdy Wilfred,” Winston said with a nod, recognizing him from local election debates. \n\n“Detective Winston...” Wilfred replied with a light bitter edge to his voice, “I trust you have everything in hand here?”\n\n“Looking into it very thoroughly, Sir, as I’m sure you’d want,” Winston replied with a subtle hint of sarcasm. \n\n“Aren't I aware of a construction project you're involved with?” Winston asked, remembering Wilfred’s role in city development. He also added, \"I remember you said you worked in the field before turning to law. And you mentioned you were especially adept with using nail guns in your construction work. That’s correct, isn't it?\" \n\nWilfred hesitated, “Yes, that there is part of my campaign portfolio. I used to be in construction, yes. And I did favor the use of nail guns over other tools.\"\n\n“I see, so you've had first-hand experience with construction work?”\n\nWilfred nodded in agreement and Winston continued, “I heard there was a nail gun missing from your site. A tool you're quite familiar with, am I right?”\n\nWilfred’s face went pale, “Why, yes, there was. We reported it...\"\n\nBefore Wilfred could complete his sentence, Winston cut in, “Do you remember Xenia?”\n\n“She had some wild accusations,” Wilfred stuttered, trying to hide his irritation, “She threatened to throw some trash into my election campaign.”\n\n“And I also heard,” Winston added, \"that she was actually explicit about her plans. In fact, she told you directly that she was going to expose your scandal, didn't she?\"\n\nWilfred’s face turned paler, “Well, yes, she did. But--”\n\nWinston grinned, \"Not just trash, Wilfred. She had physical evidence. Documents proving your indiscretion.\"\n\nWilfred gulped. Winston continued, “Her murder coincidentally took place during your unaccounted for period.”\n\nDespite the clear unease on his face, Wilfred sputtered, “I… I… That's impossible. I… I can prove my whereabouts.”\n\n“Well, Sir\" Winston said, shifting slightly to reveal the mall’s security camera pointing directly at them, \"you may have to explain why you, Mr. Wilfred, have been spotted on our CCTV not too long ago, roughly at the same time Xenia was found murdered. And let’s not forget about your high proficiency with nail guns.”\n\nBefore Wilfred had a chance to reply, Winston pulled his hat down over his eyes and walked away, leaving Wilfred in the middle of the bustling shopping mall.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

His eyes narrowed in on a peculiar piece of information; Charlotte, the victim, had reportedly been stuffed. \n\n\"That's culinary,\" Winston muttered.\n\nThe morning began with a visit to the local pet store, where Letti, a groupie with a penchant for exotic decor, was often spotted buying various animals. \n\n\"You've seen this woman before?\" he asked, flashing his badge and a photograph of Letti towards the shopkeeper. \n\n\"Oh, yeah! She comes by often,\" the shopkeeper said cheerfully. \"Always looking for some new pet to tag along with her to those concerts, I guess.\"\n\n\"And what happens to these pets?\"\n\nThe shopkeeper's face contorted, his smile fading slightly. \"Well... They just disappear, don't they? It's odd.\"\n\nHis next stop was the scene of the murder: a secluded kitchen in Charlotte's home. According to her housekeeper, it was such place which Charlotte and Letti had been seen alone, sharing the early dinner Charlotte had invited her over for.\n\nSuddenly, a lead brought him to a Pawn Shop known for its wide array of self-defense equipment, stun guns in particular. Winston slid the security footage into the player, Letti appearing on the screen, her face a match to the shopkeeper's description.\n\nShe was seen making a purchase, a stun gun catching his trained eye. Making an additional discovery, Winston found a newspaper article, along with some concert footage showing Letti using a stun gun effectively for self-defense during a music event. This was all coming together.\n\nNext, he turned towards a report stating Letti had recently signed up for self-defense classes - the kind that teaches stun gun usage. \n\nHis trail returning him to the pet store, Winston had found out that Letti had been at Charlotte's earlier in the day, according to a tip from a disgruntled neighbor.\n\nUpon hearing about the style in which the stuffing was done, detective Winston noted, Letti seemed to recognize it immediately. Could have been a coincidence, could have not; only time would tell.\n  \nDoctor Winston had his work cut out for him, a tangle of clues, and facts left behind, waiting to be pieced together. He could see, however, that the threads of this mystery were starting to knit together. The mystery deepened the more he dug into it, each fact, each clue pulling him further into the complex web spun around the suspect. The only thing left to do was to pull the right string and observe as everything fell into place. With every step, the truth was seemingly closer, yet shrouded with enough obscurity to keep him on his toes.\n\nWinston was met with a distressed and nervous-looking woman when he arrived at Charlotte's house. Deborah was shaking, a pitiful sight, as she repeated her claim: \"I was scared, I was really scared of her.\" She was a mess, with trembling hands and a trembling voice, but Winston had seen the proof of her fear in the way Charlotte treated her. Harsh treatment by a woman, once her employer and now her victim.\n\nApparently, Deborah had been scheduled to drive Charlotte that very day; a service she always offered. In all honesty, it seemed Deborah was Charlotte's only method of transportation. Winston couldn't help but wonder, though, at the intensity of her fear. Was it because of Charlotte's abusive behavior, evidenced by bruises and the testimonies of her neighbors? Or was it due to ominous messages that Charlotte had sent Deborah?\n\nDeborah's fear seemed to have had a history of manifesting physically. The word was out that she had employed a stun gun in the past, for self-protection as Winston understood. Deborah was never far from it, the weapon always at her side.\n\nJust then, Winston noticed a license on her wall. \"Used to be a personal security guard, I see,\" he commented, pointing towards it. Deborah just nodded in agreement, a simple affirmative to Winston's observation. Strange how life can take unexpected turns, Winston thought.\n\n\"Deborah,\" Winston started, his tone soothing, \"can you tell me what exactly happened when Charlotte... died?\" Deborah hesitated, her eyes moving towards the stun gun on the table. An eerily similar device was collected from the crime scene.\n\n\"Well, I...\" she stammered, \"I, um, was the last person to see her. I... I found her... in the kitchen.\" Her voice was barely audible, a whisper barely able to carry the weight of her confession. \n\nWinston didn't say anything. He simply nodded before standing up, thanking Deborah for her time and promising to be in contact. He left the house, lost in his thoughts. There was much to ponder over in this investigation. After all, the puzzle of the case was only just beginning to reveal itself.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Letti\nB.

Another murder landed on his desk. The victim, Roderick. The list of facts pertaining to Brianna, a tenacious teacher suspected to be involved, seemed to be a never-ending stream of potential leads.\n\nSifting through stacks of evidence, he came across a statement from Roderick, Brianna's boss, refusing to consider her for a promotion at work. Winston placed it on top of the pile as he planned his approach. The next piece of evidence was a statement from a valet at the luxury restaurant. According to the valet, not only did both Brianna and Roderick dine there on the night of the murder, but they were also both seen leaving the restaurant at the same time.\n\nWinston made his way over to the shooting range. A police report detailed that a pistol Brianna recently purchased and practiced with here was identical to the one used to kill Roderick. \n\nThe shooting range was winding down for the evening. Winston was able to speak to the range officer, \"So, Brianna's been coming here often?\"\n\n\"Yeah, she's really dedicated. You wouldn't believe it but she's won several competitions here,\" the range officer commented, leading Winston to the lanes where Brianna often practiced.\n\nWithin his stack of evidence, Winston found a copy of the restaurant's reservation list, confirming Brianna's presence at Classico's that night. More evidence from his stack showed that Brianna had been ambitiously seeking the same promotion at the school she worked, the promotion Roderick instead received.\n\nHe soon found himself speaking with the restaurant staff. The valet, waitstaff, and even some kitchen staff all recalled seeing Brianna leave the restaurant around the same time as Roderick. Most interestingly, they all bore witness to an argument that Brianna had with Roderick during dinner.\n\nNext, Winston stopped by the school where Roderick worked. A fellow teacher revealed how deeply disappointed Brianna was when Roderick got the promotion instead of her.\n\nWith the collected evidence, Winston knew he needed to confront Brianna. \n\n\"We've talked to the range officer at the shooting range,\" said Winston, meeting Brianna in her classroom.\n\nBrianna nodded, \"Yes, I spill my frustrations on paper targets, helps me to stay focused.\"\n\n\"Do you dine at Classico's often,\" Winston asked casually.\n\n\"Yes, once every so often,\" replied Brianna, \"I’m a regular there.\"\n\n\"I’m sure they recognized you the night Roderick was killed,\" Winston said, subtly sliding the copy of the reservations list across the desk. \n\n\"I suppose,\" Brianna said, cleaning her glasses, \"But isn’t it a little strange that a busy detective like you is asking about dinner plans?”\n\nWinston shrugged and stood up. \"Well, duty calls. It was nice chatting with you, Brianna.\" Making his leave, Winston thought about all the pieces he had gathered and how they all seemed to point to Brianna.\n\nWinston was nursing a black coffee and flipping through the case file when the first cracks of dawn speckled the dreary sky. The victim, Roderick, had been a stand-up entrepreneur before he caught a bullet. Roderick had agreed to meet his husband, Oscar, to discuss their divorce plans on the day he died. \n\n\"Why flee when you're already getting a divorce?\" Winston found himself murmuring to his empty, scarcely lit office. A note from a confidential source in the case file revealed that Oscar had heard from Roderick that he was planning to leave him. \n\nWinston's musings were interrupted by a phone call. It was Oscar's son, Josh. He cheerfully announced his excitement about the languid summer that lay ahead of him, spent at home. Winston rubbed his eyes, cracked his back, and decided it was time to pay Oscar a visit.\n\nOscar lived in a modest suburban home. The early morning dew lightly wet the sidewalk and the chill hung in the air. His silver sedan with premium rims was parked in the driveway, just as Oscar's neighbor had mentioned. She'd been seeing their car parked there with the windows down at all times lately. Upon inspection, Winston could see a receipt for a large, black suitcase on the passenger seat. He made a note of it.\n\nOscar, on the other hand, looked like a shadow of his former self. Tired eyes, unkempt hair, and the flicker of sadness in his eyes confirmed his ongoing love for Roderick, despite everything. The sad fact that he had been forced to say goodbye to his job a month ago only added to his woe. His therapist had been supporting him through the divorce-related depression, but with Roderick's sudden demise, things had taken a turn for the worse.\n\nWinston was offered a cup of coffee while he casually asked Oscar about the night of Roderick's death. Oscar offered up the information that he had proposed a toast at the private party right before Roderick was shot, diverting everyone's attentions momentarily away from the man. After having his fill of the tepid liquid, Winston got up, thanked Oscar for his time, and walked back towards his car.\n\nThe sound of his shoes crunching the freshly dewed gravel, Winston lit up a cigarette. He drove away eventually, leaving Oscar in his rearview mirror, standing in the doorway. He gave an inward groan thinking about the mountain of paperwork waiting for him at the station.\n\nIn this mess, a voice echoed in his head, 'Heard Oscar was in therapy. Depression, they said.' \n\nIt was a long day and Winston was certain, it was going to be a long case.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Oscar\nB.

The autopsy report he had been waiting on arrived. The time of death was the same as the time when a wrestling match was taking place.\n\nTerrance was Winston's main point of interest. A local rancher and sponsor of the wrestling matches, he had been cheering loudly in the crowd during that fatal match. Connecting the dots, Winston knew he had to speak to Terrance.\n\nApproaching the ranch, Winston noticed Terrance ear-deep in a chainsaw, his broad shoulders turning to reveal a modern television flickering in the living room. The news was running in the background, a constant source of information for the socially inept rancher.\n\n\"Hiya, detective,\" Terrance greeted him with a friendly pat. \"Anything I can do you for?\" \n\n\"Just a few questions,\" Winston answered. \"Heard you were at the wrestling ring during the match.\" \n\n\"Yep, I was,\" he said cheerfully. \"Half the town was there. Good match.\"\n\nWinston decided to change the topic. \"Nice TV you got there,\" he said casually, eyeing the flickering screen tuned to the local news.\n\n\"Oh yeah, not much for those Internet-fangled gadgets though. I got Cole always telling me to try out social media, but I can't be arsed to,\" Terrance said, shaking his head with a chuckle. \"He even sent me screenshots of how to set up a Facebook account. Can you believe that?\"\n\n\"That so?\" Winston said with a small smile. \"Your chainsaw, I heard you've been working on it.\"\n\n\"Well, yeah!\" Terrance nodded. \"Farm life, you know. Can't go too far without needing a chainsaw. Even took some classes on how to operate it. Can't just wing those things, y'know what I mean?\"\n\nWinston didn't respond to his comment immediately, allowing the rancher's words to hang in the air as he mentally noted his next steps in this investigation.\n\nWinston, finally relaxing after a long day, had been reluctantly pulled back into work. An old Art-dealer turned painter named Nelson, rumored to want the land where the wrestling territory lay for his next project, was his next interviewee. Winston was a practical man, but he couldn't deny that Nelson's paintings – mostly featuring wood cut in intricate details – were anything less than art.\n\n\"Morning Detective, it's my pleasure to finally meet ya,\" Nelson greeted him as he entered the studio. \n\n\"Good morning, Nelson,\" Winston replied, glancing around the room. There in the corner stood a chainsaw, paint splattered and well used. Noticing Winston's gaze, Nelson explained, \"I've been practicing with it almost daily.\"\n\nIt was part of an artist’s kit and Nelson voiced the same, \"Yes sir, that there helps me with these intricate designs, ya see?\"\n\nWinston continued to scan the room, making small conversation, \"You use this in all your paintings?\" \n\n\"Most of them,\" Nelson replied, \"It gives 'em character.\"\n\n\"I see... and it looks like you've had quite a bit of practice with it,\" Winston said nonchalantly, earning a nod from Nelson. \n\n\"Oh yes, it's part of the job, you know?\" Nelson replied.\n\nDuring his investigation, Winston caught sight of a miniature wrestling ring and ticket stubs from various wrestling matches. Nelson indeed had a keen interest in wrestling, having both attended and participated in past wrestling events. His reminders of the matches extended so far as to include the recent wrestling match Nelson attended where the tragic murder of Serenity had occurred.\n\n\"I'm sure you heard about what happened to Serenity at the wrestling match - the same one you were present at?\" Winston asked. \n\n\"Yes. Terrible thing, what happened. She was a great talent,\" Nelson replied with an almost convincing sadness, leaving Winston to consider the motives of a man who could potentially gain from her demise.\n\nWinston thanked him for his time and, as he walked away, he glanced one last time at the chainsaw and Nelson’s paintings. The next stage of the investigation beckoned him, yet he couldn’t shake off the details of this encounter just yet.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Terrance\nB.

The mystery of Kent's death was still lingering, and it had become clear that he had to delve further into the details than anticipated.\n\nWalking into the complex building, the detective stopped outside the Herpetarium where Julia currently worked. Julia once mentioned offhandedly, \"I trained as a herpetologist, that's my background.\" He stared at the array of snakes - some small, some dangerously large, but all housed carefully in glass terrariums. Julia was in the midst of handling one of the sizeable serpents, its scales reflecting the light in an almost hypnotic way.\n\n\"Julia?\" He questioned, gaining her attention.\n\n\"That's me,\" she affirmed, gently placing the snake back into its tank.\n\n\"Mind if we talk a moment?\"\n\n\"I've got nothing to hide,\" the woman replied as she led him back behind her desk, scattered with numerous manuals and books about programming and tech innovations. A receptionist's post-it came from nowhere and stuck to her palm, \"Remember: Staff Meeting. Introduce Julia – New Software Engineer.\" She rolled her eyes and said, \"I'm now working as a software engineer.\" An out-of-place office notification chimed and she shrugged.\n\n\"Did you know about the info posted on the company's Facebook page yesterday?\" He asked. She shook her head, adding, \"I never keep up with that. Too busy with my work, you see. Truthfully, I don't even have a Facebook account of my own.\"\n\n\"Do you visit the mosque nearby?\" He questioned. She nodded. \n\n\"Why, yes, I do. I was there with my cousin Kent the same day before...\" her voice wavered. \"We had a disagreement. People saw us arguing,\" she added.\n\nShe escorted Winston to her home soon after, where a vial of snake venom sat on her coffee table.\n\n\"Why do you have that?\" He asked, looking at the vial but careful not to touch.\n\n\"I work with venomous snakes, detective,\" she said, a matter of factly tone threading her voice. \"Research.\" \n\nThey had coffee in silence after that. Interesting, he thought as he left her house. He had a lot more work to do.\n\nAs Winston tied his shoe, a fellow cop whistled. He didn’t need to look up to know what was coming up next.\n\n\"Did you know snake venom can be lethal?\" said the officer as he stepped aside to let a group of zookeepers from the local zoo, renowned for its variety of venomous snakes, carry a large reticulated python past.\n\n\"Yeah, interesting creatures, snakes,\" replied Winston without breaking stride. He continued toward the office door where a zoo security guard profile was awaiting him, the guard whose shift happened to line up with the time of the Kent's death at the mosque.\n\nAs he was flipping through the guard’s file, he noticed the man’s name, Ronald. He was a unique type of security, it seems - besides patrolling the mosque during prayer hours, he also worked at the zoo, and one of his main duties involved handling the zoo's assortment of dangerous animals, including venomous snakes. God knows there were too many types of them at that zoo.\n\nHis phone rang. It was the Imam.\n\n\"Detective Winston, Kent was here for prayers daily, he was very religious,\" he said when Winston picked up.\n\nWinston thanked the Imam and hung up, then got up and headed to the mosque. Ronald worked during prayer hours which meant he could've seen Kent arriving or leaving.\n\nKent was there pretty much every day. There was no way for Ronald to miss seeing Kent on his death day.\n\nAfter arriving at the mosque, Winston saw Ronald standing guard. He prepared himself for the hard part of his job - accusations and denials.\n\n\"Ronald, we found these,\" Winston showed Ronald the documents found in Kent's possession. The paperwork portrayed previous indictments, some acquittals, some convictions. Ronald's entire criminal record laid bare on papers.\n\n\"What the hell do you want?\" Ronald's face turned red, and he grunted vehemently. \"I have nothing to do with those papers!\"\n\nKnowing better, Winston didn't continue this line of questioning and instead took a more amiable approach. \"So, you are also a snake keeper at the zoo, Ronald?\"\n\nRonald's red face softened, and he seemed slightly less tense. \"Yes, I do. I have the keys to all the enclosures, from the common rattlesnakes to the deadly cobras.\" Maybe it was the change of topic, maybe it was the sense of the authority that these keys brought him, but Ronald was less defensive now.\n\nWinston nodded, thanked Ronald for his time, then turned his back towards him, leaving Ronald alone with the darkening facade of the mosque and a bag of anxiety.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Liaising with Charlie's lawyer revealed that Charlie had altered his will just last week, although interestingly had chosen not to inform Bridget of the adjustments.\n\nUnlike the familiarity of his desk, even with a manila folder full of cold, hard facts, Winston found himself thinking about the case in the midst of the swamp, the location of Charlie’s demise.\n\nIronically, the swamp was a familiar terrain for Bridget. Before their marriage had crumbled, Bridget and Charlie used to share outdoor hobbies. Over the years, Bridget had become more than familiar with the contours and curves of the landscape. Coupled with regular sightings of her in various terrains with her crossbow, it wasn't hard to conclude that she adapted to different environments exceptionally well.\n\nPer the information provided by some of the locals, Winston discovered that Bridget was a thanatology specialist, a discipline she studied in school. It was not every day he met someone who was an expert in understanding death and dying.\n\nAfter taking a sip of his lukewarm coffee, Winston’s attention rested on another worrisome piece of information. Her business had recently gone bankrupt, and she was regularly lagging on her loan repayments.\n\nOne of her favorite pastimes coincidentally revolved around the crossbow, the same weapon which had caused Charlie his final breath. Bridget was often seen in the backyard, practicing with her crossbow, her aim true time and time again.\n\nWinston got up from the desk, stretching as he moved towards the board full of pinned photos. He had word that Bridget had recently purchased a new set of crossbow bolts. Coupled with her financial trappings, it felt ominously grim.\n\nYet what was intriguing about Bridget was her constant voracious appetite for books she often purchased from the bookstore. More often than not, the subjects of these books would smoothly slide into regular conversation with Bridget. And she made no attempts to hide these books. An array of them can easily be found nesting on the shelves in her living room.\n\nWinston leaned against the board, squinting at a photo of Bridget, crossbow in her capable hands in a rugged, unfamiliar terrain. This was a standard investigation; he had to remember that, just like any other case. But then, death by crossbow point in a swamp was far from standard.\n\nAs the mire of the swamp clung to his boots, Winston added gloves and a mask to his grim ensemble. His sharp eyes darted to and fro, the paleness of Charlie's lifeless body in strong contrast to the murky waters. He sighed softly, letting his eyes linger on the scene, before turning his attention from the horrific sight to the task at hand. \n\nHis first item of business? Nathaniel. Winston was intrigued by Nathaniel, a seemingly innocuous garbage man if you didn't know better. But he was already fully aware of the man's impressive archery prowess. Winston could easily recall the then-scrawny Nathaniel from their younger days, confidently hitting bullseyes with eerie accuracy in local competitions.\n\nA few steps away from the trashcan, exactly where Nathaniel usually invoked curiosity among his neighbors by meticulously sorting his collection, stood the very man himself.\n\n\"How've you been, Nathaniel?\" Winston shined a polite, professional smile.\n\n\"Can't complain, can't complain.\" Nathaniel responded, shaking his head slightly. \"This job, being out there collecting garbage every morning never misses a day, has its moments.\"\n\nWinston's memory was unfailing. It prompted him to remember that, disturbingly often when he saw Nathaniel in Charlie's vicinity, he was rummaging through Charlie's garbage. He'd heard Charlie say on multiple occasions that Nathaniel had been stealing things from his bin, which Charlie once confronted him about publicly. More compelling was that Charlie had reported valuables missing from his home coincidentally on days that lined up with Nathaniel's collection rounds. Winston's mind echoed these questionable correlations, \"+You're certainly involved in your work, Nathaniel. Find anything of interest - something out of the ordinary maybe?\"\n\nNathaniel tried not to wince, \"Just daily discard. But sometimes, even useful ones. The other day I even found a crossbow, still in perfect condition, just tossed away.\"\n\nWinston made a note of this in his mind, knowing that Nathaniel also held a hunting license. With his background in archery, a crossbow would certainly be of interest to him. \n\nSensing a shift in Nathaniel's demeanor, Winston asked, \"Didn't Charlie make a scene about his missing items, that time?\"\n\nNathaniel exhaled in resignation. \"He did... confronted me in front of everyone,\" he revealed, his voice sounding restrained. He focused his gaze intensely on the refuse nearby. \"And that day... that day he was found dead, it was just another workday for me. I had my morning round, like every other day.\"\n\nAs Winston prepared to leave, he asked one more question. \"Just one thing Nathaniel...your route includes the swamp area as well, correct?\"\n\nNathaniel glanced at the detective, confirming, \"Yes, the swamp isn't too far from the regular route, it's included.\"\n\nWith that, Winston shooed Nathaniel back to his routine and watched as he slowly disappeared. As his boots squished back towards the swamp, he couldn't shake off an eerie feeling about Nathaniel – the ordinary garbage man with a mix of archery skills, hunting licenses, and curious finds. For now, though, the murky waters of the swamp commanded his attention. At least until tomorrow.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Nathaniel\nB.

He liked to familiarise himself with the locals and their routines, it often helped him with his cases.\n\nA few moments later, in came Bruce. Winston knew him to spend most of his time in the rainforest, mostly alone. In fact, he was out there alone on the time of the dreadful incident. Peyton, Bruce's father, was found in the rainforest with a hatchet wound.\n\n\"Bruce,\" Winston greeted him as he approached their table. The young man nodded in reply. He seemed distracted, perhaps the pressure of the situation was affecting him.\n\nBruce ordered his usual - a steak 'blue'. The regular chef confirmed his order. It wasn't unusual, Bruce preferred his meats raw. Recently at a family barbecue, he was panned a juicy cooked burger but he asked them to peel a fresh, raw version instead. He stated that it tasted more natural, primal to have it uncooked.\n\nIn their conversation, Winston learned about Bruce's handyman skills, and his special affection towards his hatchet. He used his hatchet to do most of his chores in the rainforest, and it was maintained admirably. Unfortunately, it was reported to be missing on the day his father was found dead.\n\nWinston waited for Bruce to finish his meal before they ventured out towards the rainforest. Twilight was settling in, and the sounds of the night were emerging.\n\n\"Did anyone see you leave the forest that day?\" Winston asked, as they ambled along the rainforest trail.\n\n\"No, nobody did. I was alone,\" Bruce replied, his voice barely audible amongst the chorus of rainforest creatures.\n\nWinston nodded, asking no more questions as they walked along the darken path.\n\nWinston put down the photos of the murder scene and decided it was time to converse with Norris. He had to travel to the ferry docks for this. The rainforest, where Peyton was found, was still drenched from the heavy rains just as Winston pulled into the wharf. \n\nLooking at the lineup of ferries floating lazily against the dock, he saw that only one sign pointed towards the rainforest - “Norris’s Ferry”. \n\n“Hello, detective,” Norris hailed Winston from the deck, setting down a heavily used hatchet and a wooden board he was working on. \n\n“Norris, is it? You’ve been a ferry captain for quite some time now?”\n\n“Aye, sir. Many years. Through sun, rain and storm, the waters are like my backyard,” Norris replied.\n\n“And Peyton. I understand he crossed these waters with you just recently?”\n\n“Yeah. On the day of...the incident,” Norris replied, looking inconsolable as he confirmed Winston's words, “We had a bit of an argument.”\n\n“Argument, you say?”\n\nNorris heaved a sigh and grabbed a toolbox near his feet. He opened it revealing a various assortment of tools including the hatchet. Norris took a moment before confessing, “Peyton accused me of a past I’d rather forget. Told everyone on the ferry about my old fraud cases. A harsh reminder of a time I’d long left behind.”\n\nA profound silence fell between them as the seas gurgled rhythmically against the ferry. It looked like Peyton's accusations had stung Norris. \n\nWinston pressed further. “What kind of rumors was Peyton spreading about you?”\n\nNorris glanced away, looking out towards the sea. “Said I wasn’t the man people here thought I was. He tarnished my reputation. Made me a laughing stock.”\n\n“The last time anyone saw Peyton was on your ferry. Do you recall anything unusual?”\n\n“There was that argument, and he seemed distraught. Said he wanted to step away for a bit and enjoy the rainforest. I didn't see him again.”\n\n“And you’re the only ferryman to the rainforest?”\n\n“Yes, detective. However, once we dock, folks usually take their own paths. I don't keep track of them. Peyton was one of them.”\n\n“Well, thank you for your time, Norris.” Winston handed him his card. “I will be in touch if I need anything further.”\n\nAs Winston walked away, he took a last glance at the ferry. Norris had resumed his work. Once again the sound of the hatchet echoed off the water, a solemn reminder of the grim nature of his visit.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Bruce\nB.

Brianna, a teacher by profession. Her face etched with confusion and a hint of defiance painted an intriguing story.\n\n\"So, Brianna, let me understand this,\" Winston began. \"You work at the local school, is that correct?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Brianna said, a look of challenge in her eyes.\n\n\"And during a recent meeting, you were discussing matters about your class?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"I was giving an update on student performance,\" Brianna responded, her voice strong and assertive.\n\nJust then, a school official, the school's principal, entered the interview room unexpectedly. A look of concern was etched on his face. \"May I have a moment with my staff members, Detective?\" he asked, pleading with his eyes.\n\nWinston sighed and nodded, exiting the room. He knew from the principal that not only was Brianna not given the promotion she was considered for, but the decision had come from her colleague Roderick – he had outright refused to consider her for promotion. Feeling slighted, she had a heated argument with Roderick at school.\n\nWinston knew, Brianna was capable. She had won several shooting competitions but her recent activity showed a disturbing pattern. His colleague had told him earlier that Brianna was seen practicing with a pistol at the shooting range. A pistol that matched the murder weapon used.\n\nFurther investigation led him to a public event. Brianna was present with companions, putting on a friendly face and a casual mask of normalcy. A perfect alibi. But Winston wasn't entirely convinced just yet.\n\nHe recalled a field policeman questioning Brianna about her job as a teacher. A brave woman confident in her role, but her world had been recently rocked by disappointment.\n\nA rival teacher had been promoted instead of her. And Brianna, a competitive woman herself, seemed to be harboring some hard feelings.\n\nWinston made his way back to the interrogation room. Brianna, his current person of interest, had recently purchased the same kind of pistol used in Roderick's murder. That fact alone made him cautiously alert.\n\nThis case was far from over, leaving Winston to piece together the complex web of evidence and suspect motives. He sighed, looking across the table at the woman in front of him, contemplating the next steps in his investigation.\n\nDetective Winston sighed as he ran his fingers through his hair looking over the crime scene photographs. The sight of Roderick, a successful entrepreneur, found at a luxury restaurant, oddly felt disheartening to Winston. \n\nFrom his collected evidence, a pistol registered to Oscar's name was used to shoot Roderick. Winston thought back to the office reports he'd reviewed: Oscar recently losing his job and multiple reports of conflicts at the office. This was a man grappling with a world that was unraveling.\n\nAs he drove to Oscar's residence for an interview, Winston couldn't shake the image of the domestic dispute reports mentioned by Oscar's children. They fell into a pattern with Oscar's recent purchase of a gun and his prescribed therapy for divorce-related depression. \n\nOscar greeted Winston in the living room. The house was silent, a portrait of a family interrupted. Winston couldn't help but glance at a family picture on the wall – Oscar and Roderick, faces beaming, their children huddled close. \n\n\"Been quite a month, hasn't it, Oscar?\" Winston casually inquired.\n\nOscar nodded, not meeting Winston's eye. \"Sure has been.\"\n\nWinston got straight to business. \"What led you to buy the gun?\"\n\nOscar's face shifted slightly, attempting to mask his discomfort. \"Just felt the need to protect my family...I never wanted it to be used...\"\n\nWinston reeled back. That was unanticipated. \"Interesting...What can you tell me about the event at the restaurant?\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Oscar hesitated, his fingers tensed around the armrest. \"We were there for a private party, I'd proposed a toast. Had everyone's attention on me for a while... it was supposed to be a chance for Roderick and I to discuss our divorce...\"\n\n\"So you two were having marital problems.\"\n\n\"Yup. We... I mean, I still loved him very much. But he was going to leave me. I just wanted to talk to him...That’s all.\"\n\nWinston inclined his head, taking in every word. Here was a man on the brink, a man pushed to the very edge.\n\n\"Alright, Oscar. I appreciate your cooperation.\" As Winston went for the door, he turned back and looked at Oscar, sadly pondering the tale of a story only half told and yet becoming all too clear to him.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

She straightened her back and brushed a lock of hair from her eyes, her hands still loosely holding the dismantled firearm. She nodded.\n\n\"It's tradition. Heidi and I would always go out into the wilderness, me with my nine-two shotgun, her with her ridiculous tin of marshmallows. I remember she'd always be the one who'd leave, while I'd stay at the fire, peering into the forest, not returning to the tent.\" Grace chuckled, but her smile didn't reach her eyes. \"Even when we were out here, pushing fitness, she was looking out for safety.\"\n\n\"And you had a mutual workout routine both of you followed?\" Winston questioned.\n\n\"Yes, every day like clockwork.\" She sighed. \"But I convinced Heidi to change it. I argued it was safer, better for her. That night she was murdered, she implemented the change.\"\n\nWinston looked at her, his sharp eyes noticing the glimmers of distress in hers. \"Could that change have caused her to meet her killer?\"\n\n\"She started seeing someone. I thought it was best if we changed the time, to throw off this new person. But she didn't listen...\" Her voice held a slight edge, possessive almost.\n\nAs she related the details about her trips with Heidi, Winston noticed her rain-soaked hiking boots, mud-streaked pants, and her tired eyes.\n\n\"Looks like you've been out there yourself today?\" he gestured at her appearance.\n\n\"Busy day,\" Grace responded curtly, her gaze never leaving the shotgun she was now starting to reassemble. \"I usually got up the earliest. Not much point in sleeping when there's hunting to be done. The guys in the camp aren't morning people anyway.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Winston muttered, \"You two, you worked out together frequently, didn't you?\" \n\n\"Heidi's the one who introduced me to working out at the fitness center. We would even do so late at night, just us, a lot of sweat and a hell of a lot of heavy lifting.\" She smiled at the thought, her eyes glossing over with a mixture of remembrance and grief. \n\nWinston nodded, scribbled down a few lines in his notepad and thanked her for her time. There was still so much to understand, so much to link together.\n\nSunlight filtered in through the windows of the fitness center, casting long shadows on the equipment and machines scattered around the vast room. In the corner of the spacious gym, Chester was spotted, tending to some weights when detective Winston walked in.\n\nChester, slight in stature, belied his physical prowess as a jockey. His wiry exterior seemed incongruent with the voracious power emanated by his presence. \"Hello Chester,\" Winston began, his gruff voice noticeably contrasting with the calmness of the gym.\n\n\"Detective Winston, isn't it?\" Chester replied with ease, his demeanor not showing a single shred of surprise or fear. Just two weeks ago, Chester had started his new gig at the fitness center, partly to make some extra bucks and partly to maintain his fitness routine. It wasn't surprising to Winston that Chester would frequently show up right when Heidi, an active member of the gym, was last seen alive.\n\nJust when he had started to become regular at the gym, murmurs among Chester's gang had grown louder. They've started questioning his loyalties, not convinced that his regular visits to the gym were purely for maintaining his fitness.  \n\nTheir subtle talk was interrupted by the loud reverberations of gunshots in the distant background. Chester, an avid hunter, often flexed his shooting skills at the range nearby after winding up work at the gym.\n\n\"You like to shoot, huh?\" Winston casually pointed towards the direction of the gun shot sounds. \"Yeah. Helps take the edge off,\" Chester replied, a faint smile appeasing his otherwise-hardened face.\n\nThe conversation gradually led them to Heidi, a brave woman who had recently made criticisms about Chester's gang at a local town meeting. Their illegal activities were an open secret in town, countered only by the fear they instilled in those who dared to oppose. Heidi was the latest in the list, her fate tying in with an unfortunate coincidence: Chester's gang members are known to carry shotguns, the same kind that ended her life. \n\nDetective Winston and Chester finally diverged to their respective routines. The detective's mind was buzzing with theories, but his face was an ocean of calm. He had gathered the facts. The story had to be spun. His job could not be influenced by hasty conclusions... not when the facts all led to one presumable as intimidating as Chester.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

He rewound to the point where he noticed Lucy leave the fitness center. The time stamp showed 15 minutes after the coroner's estimated time of death of Tommy, the unfortunate victim.\n\nEarlier in the day, Winston had come across an interesting note in the primary investigations. Tommy had been receiving payments from Lucy, presumably to keep some secret that Lucy had unwittingly divulged. Tommy, however, had made known that it wasn't enough... that she needed to pay him a larger sum... a sum she wasn't able to produce.\n\nThis reality led Winston to pay some attention to Lucy. It turned out, Lucy, a known dancer, had an upcoming practice at the same fitness center on the fateful day of Tommy's demise. Lucy's dance was quite unique--she danced with a shiv, not just as a prop, but as an integral part of her performance, spinning, slashing, and twirling it around.\n\nWinston decided to visit the fitness center and found Lucy's signature in the sign-in sheet, marked at the same exact time as Tommy's estimated time of death. The receptionist chipped in, \"Lucy entered here with Tommy that day... this was actually the first time I'd seen them together.\" This suggested that Lucy had no choice but to confront Tommy in an attempt to stop his blackmailing.\n\nThe revelation about Lucy's professional life and her peculiar dance performances stunned him. The receptionist said, “If her secret was ever exposed, Lucy's career would end disastrously. As for her dance, her use of the shiv as part of her show is quite an expected sight.”\n\nMoreover, Winston discovered a faded, grubby envelope in Tommy’s gym locker. It was an anonymous letter, revealing Lucy's secret. Surprisingly, upon comparing Lucy’s signature from the sign-in sheet with the handwriting on the envelope, Winston realized Lucy herself had written the letter. Lucy, it seemed, had accidentally written the letter meant to be anonymous, revealing her secret to Tommy. This sparked a new theory in Winston's mind - Could this all be the result of a terrible mistake gone horribly wrong? Only time, and further inquiry, would reveal the truth.\n\nWinston's weary eyes scanned over the case files strewn about his cluttered desk. The steady hum of the police station's fluorescent lights created a rhythm to his thoughts; a rhythm punctuated by the geopolitical chatter of recent daily news and opinions from Tommy's supporters. \n\nFrom where Winston sat, Tommy's controversial views had certainly ruffled some neighbourhood feathers. He recalled Jacqueline, a notoriously private woman, often speaking out against Tommy in townhall meetings. Seemed old Tommy achieved a lot of local support, in stark contrast to Jacqueline's more solitary lifestyle. \n\nWinston decided to visit Jacqueline, remembering her as a nocturnal creature of sorts. A peculiar sight in their quiet suburban neighbourhood, Jacqueline walking around at midnight like it was midday. She kept to herself during the day, attending the local fitness center with methodical consistency. Made him wonder if this sudden bout of public solitude was her coping mechanism to the loneliness.\n\nHe found Jacqueline during her daily gym routine, towel draped over her shoulder, whirring away on an elliptical. She wasn't much of a people person which reflected in her sparse network of people she called friends. Despite this, she had a knack for voicing her political opinions against Tommy's propaganda since he gained popularity.\n\n\"Hello, detective,\" Jacqueline breathed out during her midday exercise regimen. It wasn't lost on Winston that Tommy met his end at this very gym, during the times Jacqueline was usually here.\n\n\"Ms. Jacqueline, how have you been?\" He asked, running a hand over his stubbled chin.\n\n\"Workin' on my fitness,\" She huffed, continuing to jog on the spot. \"You know how it is, detective. Same routine, every day.\"\n\nAs Winston drove away after their brief meeting, he couldn’t help but notice Jacqueline stepping out for her regular midnight stroll, bathed in the orange glow of the streetlights. Even as Tommy’s death sent ripples through the community, Jacqueline continued her routine unphased. Her quiet opposition to Tommy’s politics echoed in her campaign contributions, driving anti-Tommy sentiment as much as a grandma with limited friends could.\n\nGranny or not, Jacqueline's routine, political opposition, and solitary habits seemed woven tightly into this case's fabric. As Winston shifted gears, the digitized radio voices filled the car, talking about Tommy's rally, his sudden popularity, and his untimely death.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

There was Xenia; dead in the middle of the bustling shoppers. The sight of it was nauseating, but he needed to make his case.\n\n\"Wilfred, was that his name?\" Winston murmured to himself as the figure can be seen entering the mall, donning polished shoes speckled with a fine white powder, now known to be bakery flour... an overlooked piece of evidence that would probably be overlooked in the courtroom.\n\nOn the tape, there was a twenty-five minute period when Wilfred was inexplicably out of the view of any mall security cameras. It was exactly during this window that Xenia fatal incident occurred.\n\nSighing, Winston arose from his desk and set out for an encounter with Wilfred. On reaching the law firm, Wilfred's assistant informed him that he was unavailable due to a meeting. Winston took this as an opportunity to observe and wait for him.\n\nAfter emerging from a grueling two-hour court session filled with hair-raising moments that would make anyone sweat profusely, there was Wilfred. Despite the intense pressure court sessions usually bring, causing attendees to drench in sweat, the man appeared neither repulsed nor worn out. Shockingly, instead of the typical stench of hard work and nervousness, he exuded a fresh, clean scent.\n\nCurious about it later, Winston discovered off-the-record, there was a good explanation for Wilfred's mysteriously maintained freshness. Tucked away in his office was a bathroom equipped with a shower. An odd office setup, no doubt, but useful for freshening up after strenuous court sessions, Winston figured.\n\n\"Wilfred,\" Winston introduced himself as they settled onto the plush leather armchairs of Wilfred's quirky office.\n\n\"Winston, homicide, right?\" Wilfred responded, his voice steady, unruffled.\n\n\"Construction project of yours,\" Winston probed, \"is it on track?\"\n\nWilfred shrugged, \"Had some tools go missing yesterday, but nothing we haven't dealt before – just routine construction site hiccups.\"\n\nWinston nodded before dropping his inquiry, \"Among the missing, was the nail gun?\"\n\nWilfred flinched, \"How did you find out?\"\n\n\"Part of my job,\" Winston shrugged, \"You know how to use one of those, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, we use it all the time on the site. I was the one who taught the crew how to use it.\" Wilfred responded a bit defensively. This was the confirmation Winston needed about Wilfred's experience with using nail guns for his construction projects.\n\n\"And your whereabouts during this pilferage incident, can you account for them?\"\n\n\"No, I can't... wasn’t on site at the time.”\n\nWinston paused, locking his gaze on Wilfred, \"And you know the missing tools incident happened around Xenia's time of death, right?\"\n\nWilfred held his silence, his eyes momentarily betraying his composure. \"I wouldn't know about that, detective.\"\n\nWinston got up from the chair, \"Thanks for your time, Wilfred.\"\n\nAs he exited the office, his glance fell on the CCTV footage still playing on his laptop. No definitive conclusions yet, just mounting evidence. Only time would be the judge.\n\nWinston swept through the shopping mall like water, eyes scanning, earpiece transmitting information straight to the station. He was looking for Van, who had been on shift when Xenia was killed.\n\nHe spotted a muscular man with a nametag was unloading boxes from a service entrance, huffing and puffing as he went. \"Looks like our guy,\" he mumbled into his headset.\n\n\"I've been expecting you,\" said Van, the bodybuilder, wiping his sweat-drenched forehead with a well-charred sleeve. He pointed to a chair across the table, \"Have a seat, will you?\"\n\nWinston did, and before he even opened his mouth, Van was speaking, \"You know, Xenia was here almost every day. She loved this place, loved shopping. Sad thing what happened.\"\n\nWinston, not one for small talk, started grilling Van, \"You were on shift when she was killed, right Van?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I was,\" he replied. \"I ain't seen nothing though.\"\n\n\"What does your job entail?\"  Winston asked, changing the subject.\n\n\"I've got free run of this place. Lock, stock and barrel, I can move about as I please,” Van said, directing an intense look at Winston's face.  \n\n\"Your hobbies, Van?\" \n\n\"Used to build furniture for a living,\" He admitted, \"It was a bit of an obsession for a while. Even took a safety course from the local construction company.\"\n\n\"Did you now,\" Winston nodded, “Do you happen to own a nail gun?”\n\n“Bought one recently, yes,” Van said, as casually as if he were talking about the weather. “Receipt’s right here in my wallet.”\n\n\"Thanks for sharing. Are you aware that Xenia recently updated her will?” The detective shifted the conversation back onto Xenia.\n\n“Heard about it, yes,\" Van answered, Winston could see him struggling with the weight of his own words. \"She made me the sole beneficiary. At the same time, she also had me change her life insurance policy.”\n\nWinston got a call that disturbed him, \"Excuse me, I must go.”\n\nHe remembered the mail they found at Van’s house: confirmation from the hardware store of buying a nail gun the same model as the murder weapon. It added up.\n\nBefore leaving, Winston couldn't help but casually ask, \"The insurance payout, that a large sum?\"\n\n\"God-awful massive,\" Van answered after a moment of hesitation, \"And here I am buried under... well, a heap of bills, I'd rather not disclose.\"\n\nWith that, the detective left, collecting the pieces as he went.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

As he crossed the lawn towards the building out back, he couldn't help but take note of its hand-crafted allure. This was Rex's music studio, a self-built labor of love. It was a small, smart looking building, perfect for Rex's needs. The only thing he consciously chose to leave out during the construction was a restroom.\n\nAs he knocked on its singular door, he could hear someone composing music inside. The door cracked open, revealing a man infamous in the neighborhood not only for getting into altercations with people of other races but also for his often vocalized hatred for racial diversity. His slightly frazzled appearance, a telltale sign of his usual state after the stress of an intense composing session, was something that Winston had been briefed about.\n\n\"Hello, are you Rex?\" Winston asked the man, who nodded in response.\n\n\"Sorry for interrupting. I’m Detective Winston. I’m here to ask you a few questions.\"\n\nRex offered Winston a tour inside his studio. The detective immediately spotted a collection of crossbows fixed on a wall. Winston had been informed about Rex's historical weapon enthusiasm and how he was often seen admiring, even discussing these crossbows many times before with locals. Rex didn't take long to proudly discuss them, speaking about their age and antiquity. He mentioned having picked them up from an auction recently.\n\n\"These from one of those crossbow shooting classes you attended?\" Winston asked casually, nodding at the collection.\n\nRex nodded, \"Indeed. I love practicing with them every chance I get.\"\n\nAs time pressed, Winston shifted the conversation to the late Ryan, an influential figure whose pro-racial integration stance had created a significant impact in the community. Shortly after bringing up the victim's name, he noticed what he believed was a twinge of discomfort in Rex’s demeanor. Rex expressed openly his disagreement with Ryan's beliefs, confirming his hostility towards racial integration.\n\nIn between the conversation, Rex shared about his love for music, how he had built the studio with his own hands, and made the deliberate decision to not include a restroom. He also revealed why he spent most of his free time here - he had no other hobbies outside of the studio.\n\nOnce they wound up, Rex seemed even more restless, fidgeting with the sleeve of his sweater, an increased sign of stress after their conversation. Winston thanked the man for his cooperation and took his leave. As he left, he couldn't help but take a mental sweep of the meeting.\n\nRex - an accomplished music composer, a crossbow enthusiast, and a vocal critic of racial integration. And with his own hand-built music studio in the backyard, a studio he chose to leave without a bathroom, he certainly kept to himself. He shook the thought off, professionalism pervasive. He would see where the investigation would take him next.\n\nThe discovery of political figure Ryan's body in the dance studio sent shockwaves through the city. Winston’s world was closing in on him and he had little else to go on, other than a few clues collected from the crime scene and a statement from an eyewitness. The eyewitness mentioned a woman who was a familiar face on weekends around the dance studio - a woman who was often seen practicing her shot with a specific type of crossbow.\n\nWinston made his way to Mandy’s tour bus as her group was disembarking. Mandy was distinctive, enthusiastic about medieval war and had an uncanny obsession with crossbows. One such crossbow was in her tour gear collection, matching the one used in Ryan's murder. Upon examining it, Winston noted Mandy's fingerprints on its polished surface.\n\n\"Quite a collection you've got there,\" Winston remarked, casually eyeing Mandy's crossbow set. \n\nMandy turned to him with a proud smile, \"Yes, quite fascinating, don't you think? The evolution of war technology, it tells so much about the history.\"\n\nDetecting the unusual interest Mandy had in crossbows, Winston changed the subject, “Quite a route you have for your tour. Does it always include a stop at the dance studio?”\n\nMandy nodded, animatedly, “Why, yes, of course. It's one of the highlights of the tour, a lot of locals know about the importance of the studio in our cultural scene. The dance studio has always been very accommodating for us, there are no restrictions for my tour group.\"\n\nWinston moved forward with his questioning, \"I heard that your tour was passing by the dance studio around the time of... well, you know.\" Mandy's smile faded at this, but her nod confirmed the fact.\n\nThe questioning continued until Winston noticed some photographs among Mandy's collection. He quickly spotted images of Mandy and Ryan, in intimate situations. His mind started racing. Mandy's friends had confided in him about her secret relationship with Ryan and her desire for his political success. This was why she was crucial for his campaign. Yet this explained none of these situations.\n\nWell-known figures make for good scandals, Winston mused. His thoughts were momentarily interrupted by a tour spectator trying to grab his attention.\n\n\"Isn't that one of Ryan's places, where he practices dancing after hours?\" They pointed at the dance studio in the distance.\n\nWinston turned back to Mandy, \"A busy woman like you enjoying medieval leisurely activities and also heavily involved in the political scene. I heard from the eyewitness that you were practicing with the very type of crossbow that was used in the murder?\"\n\nDoing her best to keep her composure, Mandy responded, \"Yes, well, it's part of the storyline for my tour. We like to keep things interactive.\"\n\nWinston ended the conversation by wishing her good luck in her venture, his mind compiling the various pieces of the puzzle. Yet, he remained tight-lipped, knowing that in this game of shadows, the next move was never as apparent as it seemed.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Rex\nB.

Dwayne’s last ride – the car was a crime scene on its own. A car that belonged to the celebrated art dealer, Max. \n\nThe empty passenger seat next to where Dwayne’s life was taken was a jarring image, the shadow of the uneven coat hanger sticking out like some grotesque sculpture. Only two people on the scene – the deceased and the driver. Max. \n\nA few nights ago, Winston had seen the two men together at an art exhibition, both appeared engaged in animated conversation before they left together, Dwayne accompanying Max to the car.\n\nIronically, that very evening at the exhibition, when the discussion began to focus on the art trade, Max excused himself to use the restroom - a habit he had too often displayed. He was strangely elusive when it came to conversations about the art dealing business. But that wasn’t all. Later that night, someone asked Max about a recent art heist. Startled by this, he quickly switched the conversation to discuss the latest sports news. Discussing the current performance of the local baseball team to be exact.\n\nPeople attributed Max’s swift exits during trade talks as an eccentricity of an obsessed art lover, but they started becoming suspicious when Max's speedy departure followed the query about the art heist.\n\nThere's one thing about Artworld - reputation is everything. A tiny ink stain of scandal can become a tremendous blot on an art dealer’s reputation. Public humiliation, such as being caught up in a forgery scandal, could be the death sentence in this high-class world. \n\nMax knew this, he had always been acutely aware that his hard-earned reputation lay on the basic premise of authenticity. He was proud of his reputation, often boasting about his record of dealing only in authentic pieces. But Dwayne had something else in mind. Word had it that he was preparing to expose one of Max’s famed pieces as a hoax at the next exhibit.\n\nWinston decided it was high time he paid a visit to Max. The esteemed Art dealer had some hard questions to answer.\n\nWinston carefully brushed away the shards of glass that crunched under his brown leather brogues. This was not just any car. This was Dwayne's. The same car that Dwayne refused to cede possession of the keys to anyone, save for one...friend. Anthony.\n\nHe recalled his prior visit to Anthony's art studio. \"The medium is just as important as the message,\" Anthony once told him. Winston, even then, captivated by the sculptural sequences of religious allegory, all lovingly carved by the man himself with a pottage of tools, including their shared favorite -- a sickle.\n\nAnthony had recently poured his beliefs and faith into his work, passionately emphasizing his religious themes. His disquieting fervor was evident in every sculpture, each bearing an ominous sickle, a tool he had been using for the last five years.\n\nWinston shuffled through his notes and found the transcript of a sermon given by Anthony, where he vehemently said the non-believers were threats. A veiled offensive, inspired by Dwayne, who never refrained from criticizing Anthony's religious art nor his belief systems, a matter that Anthony took immense offense to.\n\nAnthony, no stranger to Dwayne's criticism, had requested a meeting with Dwayne. \"Dwayne,\" he had written, \"it's urgent. We meet by your car. You know the place.\" Anthony had the keys to the car belonging to the man he disagreed with most, the man whose disbelief became a source of disdain for him.\n\nWinston remembered the sobering reality --- he now stood at the very location of their meet. Dwayne's car. A discovery that was both alarming and fascinating, considering Anthony was, to his knowledge, the only other person who had access to it.\n\nBack at his office, Winston eyed the order forms, spread wide on his disheveled desk. Sickle after sickle being ordered in retrospect, all intended for Anthony's art projects.\n\n\"Why sickles? Isn't it a bit risqué in these times, Anthony?\" Winston once asked him. Anthony merely laughed it off, avoiding the question. Today, as he pieced together the facts of Dwayne's demise, the laugh was rather disquieting.\n\nWinston blew out a tired breath, tapping his pen against a stack of papers. This case was becoming a complex labyrinth, and Anthony, once just an artist fueled by his faith, was slowly emerging as a puzzle piece of bewildering proportions.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

It was an unusual murder scene for a city detective like him-- usually he was contending with back alley operations, not murky, middle-of-nowhere swamps.\n\nReports indicated that Gustavo, an alleged whistleblower, had a regular routine of walking through these parts.\n\nAs he was leaving the swamp, he ran into Zelda, the curator of the local history museum, an authoritative woman known for her dedication to her job. She had extensively studied ancient warfare and weaponry, which was clearly evident in the collection that she personally curated. Not only did she have a deep knowledge of the artifacts, but she also had the authority to handle and move these ancient and often fragile weapons. She once proudly showed him an antique sickle during his last visit to the local museum, telling him about its origin and historical importance as she gently moved it from its display case.\n\n\"I've seen you around here before,\" Winston said to Zelda, nodding. She seemed unsurprised by his accusation.\n\n\"I come here for research,\" Zelda explained, her eyes darting away for a moment. \"The swamp's history is part of the museum's story. It is part of my responsibility to understand it.\"\n\n“One of the local residents saw you out here on the same day Gustavo died.” Winston kept his gaze steady. \n\nZelda shrugged, her face remained impassive. \"I am often down here, detective,\" she said, \"This is my usual routine just like Gustavo. I told you before, I do extensive research for my work. It is out of my love for this museum, its reputation that I always try my best to protect\".\n\nWinston nodded, understanding Zelda’s dedication to her job had boundaries far beyond normal office hours.\n\"We've also come to know that you have the authority to handle and move the weapons at the museum. Is that correct?\" He asked.\n\n\"Yes, that's correct\" She admitted. \"It is part of my job to ensure the safety and preservation of those artifacts.\"\n\n\"Speaking of Gustavo,\" he paused, \"I heard he was supposed to testify about some mismanagement at your museum.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Zelda admitted, her voice steady, \"And yes, if it was revealed, it wouldn't have been good for the museum.\"\n\nThat was putting it mildly. A mismanagement scandal could shatter the reputation of the museum that Zelda had been ardently protecting. The fact that the scandal was related to her workplace was bad enough, but Winston knew he couldn’t jump to conclusions. All he had were facts and decisions of a dedicated curator. \n\n\"Did you meet Gustavo near the swamp on the day of his murder?\" he asked. \n\nZelda sighed, \"Yes. We ran into each other. He was on his usual walk and I was coming back from my research.\"\n\nWinston nodded, writing everything down.\n\nA rich collection of antique weapons, a murder in a swamp the curator often visited, and a testimony that could scandalize the museum. Winston knew that these puzzle pieces mattered, he just didn’t know how they fit together…yet.\n\nWinston's brief from the precinct placed him in the middle of a bitter gang feud, a suspenseful divide that festered in the city and spilled blood into the surrounding marshland. Underneath the water's murky glass lay no ordinary victim, Gustavo, brought down by a sharp sickle grudge. Autumn was at the center of his attention. A no-nonsense waitress by day and part of a notorious gang by night. He had to approach this tactfully.\n\n“Autumn,” he greeted, leaning against the checker-patterned counter of the diner she worked at. “How well do you know the swamp?” he asked, not wanting to beat around the bush.\n\n“Know it like the back of my hand,” she answered without a second thought, polishing a glass with feigned indifference. No one, not even newcomers, missed the luggage at her feet. Always packed, always ready. \n\n\"You saw Gustavo going there?\" He probed further.\n\n\"Yeah, that’s right. Walked in there alone, deep into the marshland, silly man didn’t even know which bush was which, can you believe it?\" Autumn quipped before hastily picking up a ringing phone, ignoring Winston's probing gaze. \n\nPhone calls ran high, Winston noted, a quick peek at the phone revealing a plethora of moving service contacts, seemingly at her beck and call.\n\nFurther back at her place, Winston realized why. Mail strewn all over the front yard, anyone could tell that her house was not a safe drop-off point for personal mail. Autumn had made it clear that she did not want any of her mail at her house, was she running or just being cautious? Maybe a bit of both, Winston wondered. \n\nThat particular evening, her gang members joined her. A jovial group, they laughed and shared stories of their exploits, several of them recounting Gustavo's public humiliation of Autumn at the diner. The event, Winston noted was witnessed by fellow gang members on both sides. He listened, not interrupting, taking in the resentment that tainted the air, marking it as a reminder. \n\nThere was no love lost here between Gustavo’s gang and Autumn's, he understood. The grudges ran deep, as did their desire for revenge. \n\nPerhaps there was part of Gustavo's story at the bottom of the swamp, but part of it definitely resided with Autumn and her gang. But it was more than just a personal vendetta, he could tell. Winston had come to dig, and the waters that lay ahead promised to be turbulent.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Zelda\nB.

The emails between Iris and Paige showed a scheduled meeting for the day of the murder. He looked over to Iris's company accounts and noticed a fall in profits that had been happening over some time. \n\n\"Is there anyone from Iris's family that could take over the company?\" he asked his  young assistant who was pouring over police reports in the corner. \n\n\"No, she didn't have any family,\" the assistant called back. \n\nAs Winston dig deeper into the case, he found that Paige, as Iris's direct subordinate, would be the next in line for company leadership. Questioning her could give him some more perspective. \n\nHe found her sitting in her office, fiddling with a set of keys. He couldn't help but notice she was surrounded by a collection of pens from various meets, a quirk that was both peculiar and endearing. However, his keen eye was caught by a hair tie that was nestled amongst the pens. \n\n\"You pick that up recently?\" He chimed, nodding towards the hair tie. Caught off guard, she nodded, \"Yes, it was on the floor in the office.\" Winston just nodded, filing that information away for later. \n\nDiving into their conversation, Paige admitted that Iris was a dedicated boss, refusing to cut staff numbers and that she kept investing in unsuccessful projects, much to the chagrin of others. Paige admitted to knowing about the company's deteriorating health, given Iris's stubborn management methods, yet, she seemed thoroughly sad about her boss's demise.\n\nJust then, one of Paige's employees entered, looking flustered. \"I found something weird,\" she said, showing Winston something that looked like a keyhole behind a movable panel in Paige’s desk... a stark contrast to the otherwise meticulous space around them. His curiosity piqued, Winston thanked them and left with a promise for further communication. \n\nWalking around the company's parking lot, he noticed Iris's car often in the frame of the CCTV footage. A coworker who was pulling out of the lot told Winston about seeing Iris the night she died.\n\n\"Saw her going into that meeting with Paige; she looked real tense, \" the coworker indicated a glass cabin that evidently served as the meeting room.\n\nWinston decided to question Paige further. \"Do you have a key to Iris's car by any chance?\" A flicker of surprise flashed across Paige's face as she answered, \"Yes, I do. Is something wrong, Detective?\" \n\n\"Not at all, just following up on some leads. Thank you for your time, Ma'am,\" he assured her before making his way back to his car.\n\nWinston flicked through the paperwork once more, using the dull humming coming from the precinct to focus his thoughts. In front of him, there was a landscape photo featuring Alicia in action, surrounded by a sea of flower crowns and women in long dresses. She was a wedding planner, overseeing all the details, including the transportation.\n\nHe looked deeper into the photo and noticed an electronic store across the street, where a store associate had reported Alicia making a purchase. Winston remembered speaking to that associate, who confirmed Alicia bought a stun gun there. This was a store that also sold stun guns, which had recently been purchased by Alicia. It confirmed what he was told, she did work in such a shop part-time. \n\nWinston glanced out his window, thinking pensive thoughts. The wedding required Iris’s car. It was Alicia’s job to ensure the car was used appropriately during the grand event. It certainly was a grand event, and it was a big payday for Alicia’s business.\n\n“Detective Winston, we have new documents for you.” An officer placed a file on his desk with a 'thump'. Financial statements. Alicia’s business wasn’t doing well. In fact, it was operating at a loss.\n\nHeaving a sigh, Winston packed the files into his case. He made his way to Alicia’s apartment. As he walked through the entrance, his gaze fell upon a ledge where the mail was neatly stacked. He could see a receipt peeping out. With a pair of thin gloves, he picked it up. A receipt from the shop. The same shop where Alicia was seen buying a stun gun.\n\nHe knew Alicia had studied electrical engineering during her college years. She would definitely know how to use it. His mobile device buzzed then, alerting him to a new email. It contained background info on Alicia's financials. A different kind of record... Alicia had been borrowing heavily, and mostly not from banks. Nontraditional lenders... not an ideal situation to be in.\n\nStepping outside, Winston lit a cigarette, his hand steady, but mind racing. But then, his phone buzzed again with a new update from precinct. There were multiple eyewitnesses who reported seeing Alicia and Iris together just before the incident. The last time they'd been seen together, was leaving the wedding rehearsal. The same evening when the incident happened.\n\n“Just the facts, Winston. Just the facts,” he said to himself, squashing out the cigarette and returning inside. There was more to uncover, and Alicia just happened to be at the center of it. Time would reveal the truth.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Paige\nB.

He was eyeing one of the employees behind the counter, a man named Dexter. The guy was tall, slender, and had a bright grin, almost always painted across his face. Dexter was seen engrossing himself with trinkets that sat on the edge of his desk. These weren't just ordinary trinkets, many of them were uniquely car-related, including miniature replicas of cars engines and pieces that Dexter had personally worked on with his chemical expertise. He smiled lightly as he fiddled with them.\n\nAs Winston approached him, Dexter looked up, and his eyes momentarily flickered with recognition before he composed his features into a salesman’s grin. After introducing himself, Winston mentioned Rose and watched for any reactions. But Dexter's face remained impassive, his salesman smile never wavering.\n\nInstead of just being a mere salesman, Dexter was also the chief mechanic of the dealership, utilizing his extensive background in chemistry to invent more advanced car maintenance techniques using various chemicals. His clear talent in this area provided him with a unique edge over other car sale businesses. As his shift ended, Dexter led Winston to his home, speaking eagerly about his run for a local office. \n\nAs they entered Dexter’s living room, Winston noticed a big box sitting against one wall. Piled around it were numerous trinkets, ranging from keychains to pens, from figurines to pocket watches. When Winston enquired about the assortment, Dexter revealed his routine of adding to the box each time he made a new customer. To demonstrate, he showed Winston a trinket he had recently added, telling the detective about the customer he met that day. It was his way of commemorating their interactions.\n\nThe home was filled with telling signs of his life. One thing that caught Winston's eye was a photo album lying open on the coffee table. It exhibited Dexter with various people, captions scribbled underneath each picture capturing pleasurable memories.\n\nTheir conversation eventually shifted to Dexter’s basement, and his workspace was introduced. Odd for a car salesman but not for an in-house mechanic, his workspace was filled with extensive glassware and chemicals, including several bottles of acid which Dexter often used in his inventive car mechanic works. He confirmed to Winston about his background in chemistry before becoming a mechanic and eventually a car salesman.\n\nJust as Winston was preparing to leave, Dexter mentioned something that instantly shocked him. Rose had threatened to expose him. She had figured out that he had been dishonest about his qualifications. Hiding his surprise, Winston empathically responded, and Dexter merely smiled, affirming how damaging Rose's threats were to his public image and his ongoing electoral campaign.\n\nWith the resonating echo of Dexter’s last words, Winston bid his goodbyes, exiting with suspicious thoughts playing heavily on his mind. Not only was Dexter's public image important for his election hopes but, as a renowned mechanic, any scandal could also potentially tarnish his reputation within the car dealership.\n\nThe detective, Winston, had strong coffee in his hand as he reviewed the case files laid out in front of him. His current assignment was the murder of Rose, who was found dead in her car by means of an acid attack. The type of acid was identical to those found in Daisy's performances. The perpetrator got away, leaving only a vial as evidence.\n\nRose had frequent parking spots, and her car was often seen in the lot near the locals' favorite music venue. The night she was killed, she was leaving a concert that was being performed by Daisy, a singer scheduled to perform at the same venue near the parking lot that day. Rose also notably had a sizable life insurance policy, to which Daisy was added as a beneficiary just a month before the incident.\n\nDaisy was known for her meticulously neat dressing room. She claimed it came from her aversion to the generally dirty environment the venues offered. Daisy's music album sales had been falling drastically, attested by the revenue charts Winston was scrutinizing. Furthermore, due to the cancellation of many events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Daisy had been unable to collect performance fees.\n\nDuring the middle of the practice session, Winston visited Daisy, where she was preparing for her next performance. He noticed different types of acids in small containers labeled and neatly arranged on a side table. Upon inquiry, Daisy shared how she often incorporated the acids into her performances for dramatic effects. She jokingly added, \"You should see the mess they make sometimes; this place is never clean.\"\n\nWitnesses from the concert reported seeing Daisy and Rose leaving the venue together after the show. They appeared to be the only ones in the car. Daisy didn't hesitate to confirm, \"Oh, yes, Rose and I left the venue together. She was kind enough to offer me a lift, as my own ride bailed out.\"\n\nAs Winston left the venue, his phone buzzed, reminding him of Daisy's recent addition to Rose's sizable life insurance policy just a month ago. As he drove past the venue, he saw that it was right next to the parking lot where Rose frequented. With the vial of similar acid on his mind, the pieces were starting to fall into place for Winston.\n\nDespite making some strides, the detective knew that the journey to justice was far from over. Each new location and piece of information held the potential to be the key to unraveling the mystery behind Rose's death.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Dexter\nB.

The room smelled of cleaners, a scent that clashed with the stark reality of its circumstances - a tragic and untimely death. A photograph on the fridge captured his attention - an image of Tessa, alongside a tall, dark-haired woman who he recognized as Penelope, a local tarot reader.\n\nLater on, his investigations led him to the drains where he suspected Penelope's large chemical purchase from the day before had been dumped. The local authorities confirmed it. The incident was also marked by Penelope's unanticipated visit to Tessa's place during which no witness was there to mark her departure. Despite this, a CT-TV camera at the end of Tessa's street had picked up Penelope leaving just before the estimated time of Tessa's death, something that felt unusual given Tessa's friendly, social neighborhood ethos.\n\nPenelope's home struck him as a stark counterpoint to Tessa's clean, modern aesthetic. Her decor smacked of a dark gothic undertone, featuring cherubs and pentagrams. The display left no doubt about Penelope’s approximation towards medieval tarot readers and alchemists which was further solidified by her quirky ornaments and stacks of intimidating books.\n\nWinston pointed out a book lying open on a nearby table, which displayed disturbing diagrams and descriptions of different poisonous gases. \n\n\"What's this here?\" Winston asked, pointing at it.\n\n\"O-oh, I was...reading it for a character in my book,\" Penelope stammered.\n\nShifting in her seat, Penelope added, \"A character who thinks they can commit the perfect crime, leaving no traces.\"\n\n\"Their own idea of justice, perhaps?\" Winston ventured, aware of the calculated cryptic response.\n\nPenelope nodded, emphasis paving way to dread as Winston clarified,\n\"A crime that might... involve poisonous gas?\"\n\nPenelope’s fear manifested through her expressive features, propelling Winston to probe her further.\n\n\"It appears that Tessa had found letters linking you with past offenses...\" Winston began, only to be interrupted mid-sentence as Penelope braced herself.\n\n\"She did confront me, yes. Said something about me having been involved in past crimes. I did not...,\" her voice quivered, trailing off.\n\n\"You were seen arriving at Tessa's place that evening. But, oddly enough, nobody actually saw you leave...why do you suppose that is?\" Winston asked, deliberately amplifying the tension.\n\n\"Well, I... I was there to read her tarot that evening. I was alone in the kitchen while she was getting us some wine.\"\n\n\"But still, no sightings of your departure?\" Winston pressed.\n\n\"I... It...,\" Penelope faltered, but Winston refrained from asking further questions. He pocketed his notepad before making his way to the exit. As he left, he caught a glimpse of a chemistry degree hanging by the door - a degree that censured the name Penelope on its title. This discovery validated the suspicions about her in-depth knowledge of chemistry and alchemy - fields possibly employed for darker purposes.\n\nWinston squinted over the rim of his empty coffee mug at the nervous officer seated across the table. Melody cleared her throat, uneasy under the direct and critical gaze of the grizzled detective.\n\n\"So, Tessa's bakery... it was right smack in the middle of the expansion you proposed for your patrol zone, wasn't it?\" Winston asked, pausing to lean back on his chair, \"To my understanding, all other businesses in the area were highly cooperative. Was Tessa the only one resisting the expansion?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Melody said, her tone defensive. \"And every time I tried to talk to Tessa about it, maybe cut a deal, she wasn't having it. She was the only stubborn holdout against my proposals.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Winston scribbled a note on the paper in front of him, shielding it from view with a well-practiced arm block. \"Dealing with hazardous materials... that's part of police training, right? You've taken classes for that?\"\n\nMelody nodded. \"Sure, we all have. Necessary for emergency situations.\"\n\n\"Hmm. Have access to any of these dangerous substances?\" Winston asked, his eyes flickering up from his notes.\n\nMelody puzzled over this question for a moment. \"Well, yes. We have a secure storage for them. For certain operations.\"\n\n\"Like poisonous gas,\" Winston said, as if discussing the weather. Melody hesitated and then nodded, a flicker of apprehension crossing her face.\n\n\"Have any hobbies, Officer Melody?\"\n\n\"Um, reading, I suppose,\" she said, stiffening. \"I always have a bunch of new thrillers and murder mysteries borrowed from the library.\"\n\n\"What do you read?\"\n\nMelody raised her eyebrows, almost startled. \"Different stuff. But mostly thrillers, murder mysteries...\"\n\n\"Funny. Your co-workers mention seeing you engrossed in them quite often during breaks. Read them at your house too, for a book club, don't you?\" Winston pursued, ignoring the slight flush that spread across Melody's cheeks. \n\n\"Well...yes,\" Melody admitted, nearly blushing. \"We frequently meet up at my place to discuss the latest thriller.\"\n\nDowning the last dregs of his cold coffee, Winston pushed away from the table and stood to leave. \"Well, Officer Melody,\" he said, pulling on his weathered leather jacket. \"It seems there is much I need to ponder. We'll take it from here. Thank you for your time.\"\n\nHe left Melody sitting in the cold interrogation room, her mind whirling.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The victim, Renee, was a rising star in the music scene and her death had shocked everyone. At the top of the suspect list was Isla, a devoted groupie of what seemed to be the rival band.\n\nAs he stepped onto the stage of what had previously been the sight of the unfortunate event, Winston remembered what led him here. A music gala where Renee’s band had triumphed and Isla’s favorite, struggled. \n\nWinston recalled how Isla had not taken this well. She was vocal, very vocal about her displeasure. The public declaration of her resentment - just another peculiar thing about the woman. This incident especially struck Winston because in all his discussions with Isla's friends, none of them ever mentioned meeting the band members, providing more peculiarity to Isla's obsession. \n\n\"Meeting Isla for the second time, is it?\" the stage manager asked. Winston nodded. Questions about her past had prompted more questions than answers. Publically, Isla was known to be biased against Renee's culture. Subject to discrimination lawsuits filed by those she regularly chose to isolate.\n\nGetting into the intricacies of Isla’s life had been more complicated than catching a spider in a hurricane. She never gave a straight answer about her activities in her free time, a fact that had earned her some scrutiny.\n\n\"Constant red flags with this one,\" Winston mused to himself. Isla had a knack for privacy. She left the room whenever she received a phone call. Never invited her friends to the band's concerts. Always arrived alone.\n\nOn the other hand, she was known for learning survival skills from online sources. Owned a private collection of survival tools at her home, where the infamous barbed wire was reportedly found. The same barbed wire, as was later confirmed, used against an intruder some months back. \n\nAs he was leaving, Winston got a call from a local store clerk who claimed to have sold a roll of barbed wire to Isla the day before the horrific event.\n\n“All evidence points to her,” the store clerk had said.\n\n“Nothing is for certain yet,” Winston had firmly replied. He knew the importance to avoid jumping to conclusions, let the evidence guide the investigation. With those thoughts, he tucked away his notepad and decided to keep a closer eye on Isla. The ball game was just starting to get interesting. His aim was to do whatever it took to ensure that this case reached a fair pitch.\n\nAs Winston cruised up to the crime scene, he took a moment to appreciate the opulence of the luxury restaurant. A grand piano player in the lobby, exotic flora, and a gourmet menu, it had it all. A lady, Claire as he would come to know, was sitting outside the restaurant in her car. She was shaking, clearly upset, her eyes teary and red.\n\n\"I suppose you're Claire,\" Winston guessed, peering through the passenger side window. \n\n\"Yes,\" she sniffed. \"I work here and in that place...\" she pointed feebly towards the towering construction site in the near distance. \"Merely a secretary during the day, and a skilled gardener during my time off, never a scratch from the barbed wire that fences my garden.\" \n\n\"Seems like you've got your hands full,\" Winston remarked, eyeing the construction site. \"That's a lot of barbed wire over there.\"\n\n\"Yes...\" she said, \"but I'm used to handling barbed wire. We've got some fencing my garden at home too.\"\n\n\"I heard you have keys to all sections of this restaurant,\" asked Winston.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" Claire nodded, \"the management insists we keep everything secure, and since I work here, they trust me with the keys.\"\n\n\"Why were you at the restaurant today, Claire?\" He asked, looking closely at the woman in front of him. \n\n\"I usually work at the restaurant during lunch hours,\" Claire responded. \"Today was no different.\"\n\n\"Strange circumstances today, though...\" Winston said. \"Did you know Renee was planning to file a report about some huge financial disparities at the restaurant?\"\n\nClaire squirmed a bit at his words. \"I heard something about it,\" she mumbled. \"But it's only whispers. Renee believed there was a thief... that there was someone embezzling money from the restaurant.\"\n\n\"And she thought that person was you, didn't she?\" Winston questioned.\n\nClaire's face turned whiter than it already was. \"I...I...\" was all she could choke out. \n\n\"She had evidence, Claire,\" Winston continued, taking the report out of his bag. \"She'd traced back all the missing funds to your bank account.\" He waived it in the air between them. \"She was about to expose you, wasn't she?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she whispered, almost inaudibly, confirming her role in the embezzlement.\n\nWinston left Claire in her car, lost in her thoughts.

No one expects a death in a quiet town like this, especially not in the vicinity of a swamp. \n\nThe first name on his list, Zelda, seemed to have more going on than what met the eye. As a museum curator, her knowledge of age-old weaponry was extensive. It wasn't just coincidence that a sickle, an ancient weapon she had access to and handled regularly, was found at the crime scene. These details were interesting and something to bear in mind as he further delved into the case. \n\nWinston stubbed out his half-smoked cigarette and headed towards the local bar. That same bar Zelda was known to frequent, and where she was seen starting a heated argument a few days ago. A local bystander, alarmed by the ruckus, had been the one to call the police. By the time the coppers arrived, Zelda was out of control, throwing haymakers left and right in a violent outburst. It was jarring to see that side of Zelda, a stark contrast to her otherwise serene occupation.\n\nThe victim, Gustavo, was an uncomplicated man who found his daily pleasure in wandering the swamp. Unusual to Winston's city-bound sensibilities, but hardly a motive for murder. Still, Gustavo was spotted meeting with Zelda on the day he was killed, traced back to the swamp- an important detail that gave Winston pause.\n\nAlways busy with research trips to the swamp as it housed a rich collection of archival items, Zelda rarely fit in. Her eccentricity set her apart from the local swamp residents and provided locals with ample reason to remember her presence, especially on the day of Gustavo's unfortunate demise. \n\nThe apparent lack of a connection between Gustavo and Zelda left Winston puzzled. Little did he realise, he was already neck-deep into a mystery which threatened to unravel many secrets in this charming old town. As he thanked the barkeeper and planned his next move, Winston knew the path ahead was laborious, but the thrill of the chase made it all worth it.\n\nWinston pulled his coat closer, squelching through the damp marsh under the weak morning sun. An investigation into the murder of a known gang member, Gustavo was no light task. The marsh was treacherous, and from what he knew, it wasn't a place Gustavo was familiar with. As he continued, his thoughts turned to his lead suspect, Autumn.\n\nAutumn was known to the cops as a waitress, always ready with a smile, but her reputation held something darker. She knew the marsh more than an average city dweller had any reason to. Her affiliations hinted at a troubled past, connections with a gang not so well-disposed towards Gustavo' gang. They'd often spoken of striking back at Gustavo and his colleagues, the feud between them a public knowledge. \n\nWinston had a hunch, it was more than professional. Gustavo was publicly rude to Autumn at her workplace, an act that gained notoriety when it happened amid a crowd full of fervent gangsters. The insult wasn't just personal but had the veneer of public humiliation too.\n\nWhen he inquired about Autumn's history, he was told Autumn had once been a farmgirl, that she knew her way around a sickle as well as she did with serving plates. A fact, which though unrelated, intrigued him due to the choice of the murder weapon. \n\nPassing by the marsh's edge, he spotted a decrepit wooden sign etched with the name of the swamp-side restaurant Autumn worked at. It was there Gustavo had his dinner last night, all while directing contemptuous remarks at Autumn, as witnesses reported. \n\nAnd it was from there, Autumn saw Gustavo enter the swamp that treacherous night, alone. Something nobody else could vouch for.\n\nLater that night, sipping on a cup of lukewarm coffee, Winston ran over the day's findings. Gang feuds, public humiliation, skills with a sickle, an intimate understanding of the marsh...\n\nHis job wasn't to arrive at conclusions, but to collect the facts, the facts that would eventually help the force bring Gustavo's murderer to justice. As a detective, his role was, as always, laying down the path for others to tread.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Zelda\nB.

Serenity, the star wrestler, had publicly threatened her opponent, Terrance. And Terrance, poor lad, was found pale and trembling after their match. Terrance was no stranger to the grit and physicality of ranch life, but the wrestling ring was another story entirely. He had been in the losing end of a previous matchup with Serenity. \n\nFinally placated by the caffeine and recalling his purpose, Winston trudged to the boots and scruff leather of the local ranch. He was greeted by the sight of Terrance coordinating his ranch work, his sun-worn skin a testament to long hours under the warm Texan sun. \"You're Terrance I suppose?\" Winston asked, as he gestured to the flourishing land around them.\n\n\"That'd be me, Detective,\" Terrance replied in a thick southern drawl. \"This land's been around longer than I have. Been a rancher all my life.\"\n\nThere was an odd sense of hitched anxiety when Winston brought up the chainsaw classes he'd heard Terrance attended. \"Gotta know how to operatin' it,\" Terrance replied. \"Helps keepin' the place run smooth.\"\n\nWinston hustled over to where the recent wrestling match had taken place. It was a local tradition in the town and Terrance was no stranger to it, being a regular sponsor. It was a sweltering evening when he found himself at the scene, their wrestling ring splattered with the remnants of what occurred.\n\nReturning to the station under the glow of disjointed neon lights, Winston on a hunch asked a few local attendees about the particular wrestling match where Serenity was killed. Terrance was in the crowd that night, cheering heatedly during the match.\n\nIn a more relaxed visit to the local bar, Terrance appeared more forthright. \"She was strong, Detective. Really strong,\" Terrance eased into his confession after a few sips of his drink. At another instance, in a low murmured admission to some friends, Terrance had been heard saying he felt threatened by Serenity. There were rumors around of Terrance being seen frequently repairing a chainsaw. The very same chainsaw Terrance learned to operate, and the chilling instrument that ended Serenity's life.\n\nFor now, this was the puzzle Winston had to unravel. He gave Terrance a long, discerning look over the rim of his beer glass before leaving the lightly crowded bar. On his way out, the words of a recent reports echoed in his head, “A chainsaw is essential in ranch work…”\n\nWinston had been downing cups of coffee all day, trying to make sense of the pieces of what seemed like a nonsensical puzzle. He made a decision to visit the place it all transpired – an old, grimy wrestling ring where Serenity had met her horrific end.\n\nThe image of the chainsaw used as the murder weapon kept coming back to him. So brutal was it that Winston found it hard to shake off. He had heard that Nelson, the painter and prime suspect in the case, had been seen training with a chainsaw - a tool that he directly employed in his painting procedures, forming part of his job. The oddity seemed to strengthen the potential motive Nelson had for this grim act and Winston felt compelled to pursue this lead.\n\nAfter a quick tour to the local gallery, Winston visited an exhibition where Nelson's pieces were showcased. It was evident that his chainsaw artwork had amassed some level of local attention, owing to their exceptional detailing accomplished with a chainsaw. Nelson adored wood, especially intricate shapes created out of it. He would often proclaim that shaping wood using his chainsaw was an integral part of his painting role. His proficiency seemed uncanny, almost eerie, but the public admired his work for its notable woodsiness.\n\nFrom the gallery, Winston travelled to the correction facility where Nelson used to work. The officers seemed reluctant to speak about the past events which led to Nelson's termination and the painter's complete obliteration from the collective memory. Winston found no records of Nelson in the personnel files. His data seemed to have been deliberately wiped out, prompting Winston to question their collective avoidance in discussing Nelson.\n\nWinston then moved to his final stop, Nelson's quaint bungalow. Unusually quiet and still with the curtains tightly drawn; not the usual sight, as reported by neighbors who mentioned Nelson's affection for painting under natural light. Winston learned that Nelson had ceased attending the weekly game nights at the local pub, coinciding with his new preference for drawn curtains.\n\nAs Winston introspected leaning against his car, he realized the significance of the patterns in the changing behaviors of the painter. Winston was now confident that Nelson indeed had a strong motive in Serenity's demise – albeit, this was supported by an eerie amalgamation of evidence: the drawn curtains, the nonattendance at the pub, the wiped data, the unusual termination, and finally, his habitual, ominous use of chainsaws. \n\nTime was ticking away, and Winston was now more determined than ever. He drove away from Nelson’s bungalow, deep in thoughts about the painter and his last works that haunted his thoughts. The presentiment of the forthcoming day, the hunt for more truths and the justice for Serenity, was overwhelming. Each passing hour made the air heavier with unspoken truths, and Winston was resolute to unthread them all.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Terrance\nB.

He was there to have another interview with Martin who, under more normal circumstances, would be found reading alone during his breaks at work.\n\nMartin, equally known for his solitary nature and his keen avoidance of social gatherings after office hours, was already waiting at the meeting point. His previous interactions with law enforcement had accustomed him to this type of meeting. Indeed, Martin was a suspected serial killer, having been investigated in several similar cases, none of which were ever concluded definitively.\n\nStanding just inside the entrance, Winston looked at Martin, the solitude seeking man currently immersed in a book, a common sight both at the temple during his regular visits for deliveries and at his workplace. Martin, preferring solitary tasks at work and overlapping his lunch hours with the team's break time, seemed at ease with the solitude. \n\nClearing his throat, Winston begun, \"Martin, I understand you've been working as a delivery driver for quite some time now. On the day of Olivia's murder, you were making a delivery to the temple.\" \n\n\"Yes, that's true,\" Martin lowered his book and met the detective's gaze. “Olivia’s package was in my load,\" he admitted, his voice controlled and steady.\n\nA silence fell upon the room, underscored by the emptiness of the temple. It started to sink in for Winston that Martin was the only person here at the temple when Olivia was murdered, and the circumstances made him look like more than just a delivery man due to do his rounds. \n\nThe silence was finally broken as Martin returned to his solitary activity, unfazed by the heavy atmosphere. His continuous composure, even in face of a murder investigation, gave cause to unease. Olivia bore a striking resemblance to his previous victims, which made Winston wonder if this was indeed the work of the same suspect. With a heavy heart, Winston retreated, leaving Martin with his quiet solitude and an unresolved suspicion.\n\nDetective Winston strolled into the ancient temple, a hallowed ground gone silent. The only room disturbed was the small, private chamber, where Xochitl conducted her tarot readings. The place was still thick with incense and wine, the latter spilled and sour.\n\nOlivia attended Xochitl's tarot reading the day she was murdered. Olivia had always been a consistent presence, never missing a session, always there, purposefully disturbing Xochitl and her sister... a fact which Winston had been made aware of. \n\nAppointment with Xochitl for an interview was set. Petite woman with a weathered yet kind face greeted him at the entrance. She was regarded as the temple's best tarot reader and she wore it like a badge, conducting her readings with sincerity and attention to detail.\n\n\"Detective, Olivia did always say she'd ruin my sister's life...\" Xochitl said her voice barely above the whisper.\n\nHeard about the threats. Even more, Xochitl had found evidence of Olivia's plans. Yet Xochitl loved her sister deeply. Wouldn’t let anything hurt her sister. Her protector, her safe harbor, her friend.\n\n\"I thought she was bluffing... just harassment. But I found her notebook... she was actually planning to destroy my sister,\" said Xochitl, her voice sullen.\n\nThe day Olivia was murdered, Xochitl and her sister had had an argument with Olivia. At the temple. Spiteful words thrown around like daggers. A disturbing element in the peaceful temple environment. Wine helped, they said; it added an element of relaxation to the readings. There was always a corkscrew on the table. It was just... there.\n\n\"Today was like any other day. The tarot reading was going well, till Olivia showed up. Always tried to disturb us, hurt my sister,\" her voice filled with sorrow and worry. \n\n\"The tarot did warn of a danger... I didn't know it would be this way,\" she said looking away, eyes filled with horror and regret.\n\nWinston thanked her for her time and left the temple grounds. This case was far from clear, and every fact had to be combed ain. How had it come to this? Traces of threat, a protective sister, an uncompromising victim… he had a long analysis ahead.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Xochitl\nB.

He detested the musky smell of the swamps where Ricky's body was found that same day. But of course, the repugnance a crime scene induces is not a criterion to be considered in investigations. \n\nHis letters of introduction remarked that he would be received by Glenn, a local dentist. As Winston rounded upon the dental clinic, he couldn't fail to notice the tell-tale smell of sterilizing bleach that hung heavily in the air.\n\n\"Morning Doctor,\" Winston said as he walked into the clinic.\n\n\"Good Morning, How can I help you?\" replied Glenn.\n\n\"My name is Winston. I am investigating the death of one Ricky,\" he explained.\n\nGlenn visibly shuttered at the mention of Ricky's name, \"I had seen him recently for a root canal.\"\n\nWinston wasn't too surprised by this. Many victims' last known location turned out to be places where they had felt safe. He made a mental note of it but didn't engage in any further discussion about Ricky.\n\nHe noticed a desktop computer nearby where a dental science forum was open. Topics on toxicology and possible risk factors danced on the screen. \"Is that what you were doing before I walked in?\" Winston mused aloud.\n\n\"I was catching up on some forensic odontology discussions. It's my area of specialty,\" Glenn explained, sounding unusually enthusiastic about the subject. \n\nTickets to Ricky's funeral were spread out on Glenn's desk, indicating that he'd likely be offering his last respects to the deceased individually. The dentist, a loner by appearance, never invites anyone to his remote house where he lives all by himself. This he didn't strike Winston as the kind to mingle at a social gathering.\n\nWinston inquired about Glenn's whereabouts for most of the day Ricky was murdered, to which Glenn quickly responded, \"I was out birdwatching at the swamp.\"\n\n\"But I heard you live in that isolated homestead,\" Winston said, diverting the conversation towards Glenn's personal life, \"You don't usually invite anyone over?\"\n\nThis time, Glenn didn't just show discomfort. He stammered and went pale. Clearly, his anxiety was rising at each personal question, \nand in an effort to divert the conversation, he interjected, \"Do you know that prolonged use of teeth whitening treatment can cause oral cancer?\" Winston was taken by surprise at the sudden change in conversation but chose not to question it any further. \n\nWith that, his introduction to Glenn was over and his investigation continued.\n\nDetective Winston pulled up to the prison, parking his car between the tall, barbed wire fences. Beyond them, he could see a swamp, the murky water shimmering with heat. Footsteps echoed through the sterile, concrete halls as he made his way inside, passing groups of colorfully uniformed prisoners on their way to and from various responsibilities. \n\nBrushing off some of the dust still clinging onto her orange jumpsuit, Tessa sat in the visiting room, the corners of her mouth curled into a hint of a smile. \n\n\"Tessa,\" Winston began, \"You work here on farms, correct?\"\n\nShe nodded, crossing her arms over her chest, \"Yeah, that's correct. We've got a swamp nearby too.\"\n\nWinston wrote something down, answering with a nonchalant \"Mmhhm.\"\n\n\"And before prison... you were a high school chemistry teacher, weren't you?\"\n\n\"Yeah,” she grumbled, “From Bunsen burners to mop buckets.\"\n\n\"So, your current job here... cleaning, right?\" to which Tessa confirmed. \n\n\"And in turn, they provide you the cleaning supplies?\"\n\n\"Yep,” she mused, “A mop, bucket, soap, gloves... bleach. Everything a good custodian ought to need.\" \n\nWinston scooted himself forward a bit, \"You were disciplined once for using bleach incorrectly, right?\"\n\nHer face turned expressionless. \"That was years ago. Nothing but some harmless experiments.\" Tessa asserted.\n\nAs minutes rolled into hours, the conversation moved onto the victim, Ricky. Ruffling in his seat, Winston asked about the dwindling debt between Tessa and Ricky. \n\n\"He couldn't just wait, huh? Always pestering about the damn debt. I tried to repay him, but it just never seemed enough.\" Tessa confessed, clenching her fist, \"He even threatened me over it.\"\n\nUnderneath the fluorescent lights, Winston could see her distress - unable to keep up with Ricky's demands despite her financial limitations. \n\nRemembering his autopsy briefing, Winston knew Ricky was found in the very swamp near the prison's farm. Perhaps, Tessa knew something...\n\n\"Ricky's body was found near the swamp, past the farm.\" Winston stated.\n\nA flicker of shock passed through Tessa's eyes before her face returned back to its hardened, impassive state. She may not have expected anyone would find him, or for the news to reach her this quickly. \"Near the farm, within the walking distance he murmured...\"\n\nHe thanked her for talking and left, leaving Tessa alone in the visiting room. \n\nAs he walked back through the dense crowd of prisoners, past the pungent smell of bleach cleaning the hallways, Winston realized, this was going to be a difficult case to crack. A life lost over a debt, and the swamp held many secrets yet to reveal.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Glenn\nB.
