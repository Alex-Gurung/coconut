A quick brushing of the autopsy report led him to understand the brutal nature of Guy's death... by way of a Sai.\n\nUpon inquiring further into the murder weapon, he found out about a certain niece, Peyton, who was identified as a collector of such items. Weapons, all different kinds, were Peyton's obsession. Her fixation was so strong that it even crossed over to her recreational time, she took martial arts classes weekly. \n\nA thought popped into Winston's mind and he felt a sudden rush of adrenaline; Peyton was also proficient with the sai. The words of her martial arts instructor echoed in his mind, \"Peyton is proficient with the sai and many other weapons. She almost scared me with her skill.\"\n\nWinston moved on to Peyton's employment status. She worked daytime shifts. Interesting, he thought, as the mall murder had taken place at night. A leak about Peyton shopping frequently at the murder scene and her evident fondness for shopping only seemed to deepen the investigation.\n\nRecalling a statement of one of Guy's friends, he said, 'Guy told me he was planning to expose Peyton's secret'. Guy was about to spill Peyton's secret, and she had reacted to this threat fearfully, as if something precious was at stake. Winston remembered hearing the intense words Peyton had uttered \"I won't let you ruin me, Guy!\" Her secret was something she was desperate to keep hidden.\n\nHe crumpled the empty coffee cup in his hand. Time to speak to Peyton.\n \nAs he drove off, he couldn't help but wonder. Just what was Peyton's secret? And what lengths did she go to, to keep it hidden? Winston knew he had to tread lightly, every piece of the puzzle mattered, even more so when everyone was a suspect.\n\nThe constant clinking of glasses and din of jovial voices filled the air as Winston idled near the polished oak bar. His eyes were focused on the bartender - a stern-looking woman named Isolde. He had heard the rumors about her refusing service to customers from Guy's ethnic background, and those claims had piqued his interest. Guy himself had complained to his family about this, and the distaste in their voices as they spewed recounts of the tales was a clear indicator of the gravity of the situation. Isolde was not just known for her reputation as a martinet bartender but was also notable for her martial arts prowess, evident when she was seen practicing with sai at her martial arts school. Her frequent sai practice sessions at the school held his attention tonight.\n \nLeaning on the edge of the bar, he made eye contact with her. Isolde's expression was guarded as she glanced at him once, appearing hesitant because of the past. Guy's coworkers, who frequented the very bar, had shared stories of hearing racial slurs she had thrown at Guy. They had also relayed these offensive exchanges to Guy's family, fueling the flame that Winston was now looking into. He recognized her from those recounts, the complaints about the woman named Isolde vivid in his memory.\n\nMeeting her gaze, he gestured to the collection of martial arts DVDs displayed at one corner of the bar. \"Into martial arts movies, I see.\"\n\nIsolde’s eyes lit up momentarily, \"Absolutely. Their craft, the plot twist…nothing beats it!\" She was known to vouch for these movies, frequently recommending them to curious customers, as she did now with him. Her deep love for these films was quite apparent as she quoted lines from them frequently, the quotes seamlessly merging into her bar-side conversations.\n\nObserving the martial arts weapons mounted on the walls behind the bar, Winston's eyes landed on a wall-mounted sai set. Distinctively, a vacant slot stood in the otherwise complete collection. During the investigation in her bar, a sai from the set was found missing. The rumor circulating was that the sai reported as Guy's murder weapon had eerily similar markings as the ones in Isolde's set.\n\n\"Nice collection,\" Winston said, pushing his empty glass forward \"I will have another. Do you also train with these?\"\n\n\"Always,\" Isolde responded while working on his drink, pride apparent in her voice. \"I hold a pretty high rank at my martial arts school.\"\n\nMoving on to less savory topics, Winston treaded cautiously. He mentioned seeing a few of her offensive posts on social media. Public posts that specialized in racial slander, foul comments directed towards members of Guy's race. Guy had told him about these posts, how they pained him to see such a blatant display of disrespect. They had all heard these derogatory comments, remembered her posting them on that unusually loud megaphone of hers - the internet.\n\nIsolde noticeably stiffened but kept her silence, surely aware that these open refusals to serve customers, based on their ethnic backgrounds, had led to a flurry of complaints. Her behavior gave him pause, her hostility towards Guy perceived in her demeanor. Winston sighed, thinking about Guy and his coworkers, who had overheard the hostile conversations during their visits.\n\nWinston finished his drink, neatly placing a folded cash note on the table. As he stood up to leave, a sly smile curled up on his lips. This, above everything else, was just the beginning. He exited quietly, leaving Isolde to mull over their conversation and the consequences that might ensue.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Peyton\nB.

The sight of the young boy stretched out lifeless in the woodland was an image too jarring to easily forget.\n\nDropping his files onto the table, Winston decided to visit the scene of the crime, the local campground where Ernest and many others had gathered for a large party. As Winston walked around the now abandoned campsite, he noticed a few items left behind by the careless partygoers. It was here Ernest had been found, brutally murdered with a crowbar. \n\nAddison, a classmate of Ernest and a regular at the campsite, had been present on the day of the murder. Winston had his eye on him, based on the information he'd received. \n\nNext, Winston decided to pay Addison a visit at his place of work. As an apprentice mechanic, Addison spent his days working hard in the garage, using a variety of tools. The garage was a mess of wrenches, screwdrivers, and yes, even a few crowbars. It seemed only natural for a mechanic to possess such tools.\n\n“Detective Winston. To what do I owe this pleasure?” Addison greeted him as he entered the garage, leisurely cleaning his hands with a rag.\n\nWinston showed his badge, “ Investigating the murder of Ernest.”\n\n“Yeah, very sad stuff,” Addison said sighing heavily. \"Ernie and I went way back. Even went camping together at the same site.\"\n\nDigging further into Addison's background, Winston found that this small-town mechanic apprentice was surprisingly also a scholar. He had been accepted, on scholarship, to a prestigious college based on his impressive grades.\n\nImpressive, unless you got wind that perhaps not all of his grades were honestly won. Winston found out that Addison indeed did cheat on a major exam. This was not unusual, save that Ernest knew about it and had threatened to go public, potentially jeopardizing the prestigious scholarship.\n\nAs Winston confined his investigation for the day, he couldn't help but remember what Addison had said, \"Getting that scholarship, it's my ticket out of this town,\" he had said. Then he’d paused, rubbing the back of his neck before adding sheepishly, \"It could be revoked though, if my grades were to suddenly drop.\" \n\nAnd so the day came to a close, and Winston was left with his thoughts. But something told him that this case was far from being resolved.\n\nDetective Winston rolled up to the police station for the task laid before him. Busy with daily hustle and tasks, it wasn't an unfamiliar sight, but today it felt unusual. He was at the station to interview one of the very ones who uphold the law – Octavia.\n\nApproaching her desk, he saw Octavia fiddling around with her phone before tucking it away hastily. Winston noticed her coworker attentively watching Octavia, before briefly meeting his eyes and offering a sheepish nod. \"I saw her deleting some of those social media apps off her phone this morning,\" the coworker whispered as Winston passed by him. He added quickly, \"I could recognize the logos before she removed them.\" \n\nTaking a seat by Octavia, Winston introduced himself, while subtly inspecting Octavia. She seemed alert and in control - typical traits of a trained officer. \n\nAfter a brief conversation about her duties, Winston asked, \"I hear you were on patrol last night?\" \n\n\"Yeah, I was,\" Octavia responded with a steady voice, maintaining eye contact with Winston.\n\n\"Did your route include the campgrounds?” Winston queried but Octavia was already nodding, her face passive.\n\nWinston, attempting to glean more from her body language, asked for a photograph of her for reference. \"I am afraid that's not possible,\" she responded tersely. \"I don’t allow photographs of me to be taken. Privacy is valuable to me.\"\n\nWith this, she offered a polite smile, excusing herself to attend to her duties. Winston nodded, got up, and left the station.\n\nLater on, he found himself at the campgrounds where Ernest was killed. The site was filled with chatter and murmurs of curiosity. Many among the crowd knew of Ernest who had somewhat of a reputation for exposing secrets.\n\nWinston learned that Ernest had discovered Octavia's secret illegal activities carried out long back in her past. Moreover, he discovered a draft email on Ernest's phone, intended to be an expose of Octavia, indicating that Ernest was planning to reveal this secret. A secret – now known to him and evidently, Ernest himself – which Octavia would have wanted desperately, especially to kept hidden from her colleagues, from the department itself.\n\nAt a party, she was heard saying, \"I value my privacy more than anything.\" This reassured Winston of her dedication to keeping her past hidden.\n\nAs dusk set on the campgrounds, Winston recollected the events of the day pondering his next move.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The art community was all abuzz when Wilhelmina, a renowned collector of medieval artifacts, was found dead in her kitchen. She'd been killed with a crossbow, of all things. It didn't quite fit the typical mold, and that's why Winston was on the case.\n\nNicole had the appearance of a comfortable art critic. She was fairly calm during their first meeting, not a trace of nervousness to be seen. She’d greet Winston at the entrance of her well-decorated abode, leading him through the extensive art collection adorning her vast living room.\n\n“I remember Wilhelmina well,\" Nicole began, her voice a steady lull. \"She came over on the day of the tragedy. I invited her for coffee and some snacks. I had been shopping recently and noticed they had her favorites. She loves-...loved my cookies,\" she said, correcting herself, swallowing hard.\n\nWinston acknowledged her with a nod. \"I see, Nicole, I see. I did happen across a grocery receipt, showing the purchase of snacks matching the preference of the victim, dated for earlier that day.\"\n\n\"Did you?” She replied but seemed to fiddle with her bracelet, her eyes avoiding his upon the mention of the grocery receipt. He noted her hesitation.\n\nThroughout the day, Nicole didn’t leave her house for anything. She was alone until Wilhelmina came over, which made her prime suspect number one, especially given her past.\n\nJust as Winston thought he’d collected all the essential pieces from Nicole, something strange occurred. He asked her about her computer, whether anyone else had used it recently. The mere mention of the device made her stutter and break out in beads of sweat.\n\n\"Oh, uhh. Well, yes... My friend, she was here... Umm, she was looking up some artist on my computer... I don't really remember the name... with all these artists I encounter, it's hard to keep up,\" she stuttered out the answer nervously, a stark contrast from before. Her awkwardness made Winston ponder.\n\nWilhelmina's case stacked on top of some disturbing history from the police department, that every person Nicole had been close to, had died under mysterious circumstances. These were especially disturbing as they all were art collectors, similar to Nicole, and their valuable pieces all ended up in Nicole's own extensive collection post mortem.\n\n\"What about medieval art auctions?\" Winston asked, out of nowhere. He saw Nicole's eyes grow wide for a moment.\n\n\"Ah, yes. I frequent those quite often...,” she admitted.\n\n\"Interesting.\" Winston got up and offered her a polite smile. \"Thank you for your cooperation, Nicole.\"\n\nDetective Winston was studying the photos of the crime scene - the kitchen of the late Wilhelmina. Despite the violent nature of a murder usually committed with a crossbow, the scene was neat, a strangely peaceful sight.\n\nLeaning back in his chair, Winston skimmed through recorded transcripts of interviews with the acquaintances, friends, and regular attendees of Wilhelmina's yoga sessions which were led by Isabelle. Reports stated that Wilhelmina had a knack for creating controversies with her words, as she used to openly criticize religious groups. One of these transcripts included a voice recording. From this recording, you could hear the voice of Wilhelmina openly criticizing a certain religious group that Isabelle, her yoga instructor, was associated with.\n\nHis eyes then moved to the witness statements his officers had collected for him. Notably, among many others, there was a statement from one of Wilhelmina's housemaids. She noted that she had seen Isabelle in the kitchen during one of the yoga sessions, which coincidentally occurred around the same time as the murder. The yoga sessions, under Isabelle's supervision, were attended by various regular attendees including Wilhelmina and took place in various locations within Wilhelmina's house. The kitchen where Wilhelmina was murdered was frequently one of these locations.\n\nWith a sigh, he set aside the paperwork and looked over at Isabelle's social media accounts on his department-issued laptop. She had posted multiple pictures demonstrating her skills with a crossbow and in fact, she even had a post flaunting her own crossbow. On top of that, she was part of an archery club which included the use of crossbows. \n\nSitting upright, rubbing his eyes, he recalled the details of the meeting with Isabelle in her house, where they found literature that supported the ideas of religious extremism. The vigilant neighbors also reported Isabelle attending a series of meetings with known religious extremist groups.\n\nThe clock was now ticking near the end of his shift. Even as the day transformed into night, Winston was consumed by the intricacies of the case. Evidence was meticulously compiled for further discussions with his team. He took one last glance around his office before he finally decided to call it a day, ready to embark on the journey of solving the mystified death of Wilhelmina.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Checking his watch, Winston observed the room to be empty of people except for himself and Clyde. It was a known fact Clyde only did his cleaning when there was no one else in the room, a peculiar habit of his. \"Evening, Clyde,\" he said by way of greeting.\n\n\"Detective,\" Clyde returned, his face neutral. His large lawn, recently mowed, was visible through the window. The neighbours had seen him mowing it just yesterday, a job required a heavy machine like a lawnmower which, due to its aggressiveness, demanded some level of foundational weapon training.\n\nWinston gazed around the room, making a mental note of the pristine condition of the house. \"You keep a fine home,\" Winston commented, to which Clyde merely offered a grunt of response and continued his clean-up. He knew the moment guests would arrive, he'd start cleaning again from scratch in his usual obsessive way.\n\nWinston then recalled what some prior guests had mentioned, they noticed certain items of theirs were missing when they left Clyde's house. He quoted an instance, “Mr. Johnson, your neighbour across the street told me about his missing gloves after he visited your house last time, have you noticed it by any chance?”\n\nClyde's face stiffened, \"I don't know anything about that.\" But Winston noted down this peculiar fact as a part of his ongoing investigation.\n\nWinston Revolved back to the event driving all this, the promotion ceremony where Faith publicly tore Clyde's reputation to shreds. She ridiculed Clyde's failures in front of many familiar faces causing him an unbearable public humiliation.\n\n“Must’ve indeed been rough for you, being humiliated by Faith in front of everyone at your promotion ceremony,” Winston prodded, causing Clyde to stop his cleaning abruptly. \n\n“You know, a man can only take so much humiliation,\" Winston mused, seemingly thoughtful. \n\n“Oh, I intend to get back at her, in my own way,\" Clyde promised, his tone carried a chilling promise of revenge for Faith's public humiliation. \n\nWinston observed Clyde for a moment longer, then rose. \"Thank you for your time, soldier.\" The air around them remained heavy with tension as Winston took his leave. Clyde resumed his cleaning, in the same methodical way he had been seen to do, especially when the room was devoid of people.\n   \nThe formerly unsolved pondering over Clyde's peculiar habit of cleanliness and guests’ missing items seemed to fall into perspective as Winston left the house. Clyde’s indomitable spirit of cleanliness and the mysterious case of the missing items could possibly be related, and with his revenge plans, it was fair to say that Winston's investigation was still far from being concluded.\n\nWinston stood in the quiet, domestic confines of Faith's kitchen, the peculiar scent of freshly cut grass now forever associated with the grim sight that lay before him. His gaze shifted towards the adjacent tool shed, the door slightly ajar, wherein lay the murder weapon, a lawnmower of all things. \n\nA grimace etched itself across his face as the details replayed in his mind, the cards dealt out complex and interwoven. \n\nStepping away from the grisly tableau, he hopped into his car and headed toward a nearby barbershop. The sign flickered in the early evening light, appropriately named, 'Paul's Barber Shop'. The shop was all but empty, a lone barber stood, idly whittling his time away by cleaning a pair of scissors. \n\n\"Help you with something?\" His voice echoed throughout the empty shop. \n\n\"I'm Winston, I work with the local force. You wouldn't happen to be Paul, would you?\" Winston probed. \n\nThe man just nodded, his expression hardly changing but for the most minute hint of incredulity, as he replied, \"Yeah...I am Paul. Something I can do for you, detective?\"\n\nWinston gave him a cursory once-over, noting the man's weary demeanor, \"I'm sure you're awfully busy, but I'd appreciate a few minutes of your time. You knew Faith, didn't you?\" \n\nPaul maintained his stolid expression, his reply crisp and composed, \"Yeah, I knew Faith...quite well as a matter of fact. Been tending to her lawn a bit here and there, alongside my barber duties. She even let me use her bathroom once.\" \n\n\"So, you would've had fairly regular access to her kitchen... The crime scene?\", Winston asked casually.\n\n\"Yeah, sure. Actually, that's where she'd serve me sweet tea while I took a break from yard work\", Paul said, while sharpening the blade of his razor.\n\nAs Paul continued his maintenance routine of the various paraphernalia around him, something clicked in Winston’s mind. Blades... a lawnmower, scissors, razors. All need maintenance, all have blades, and then it struck him. All require a sharp edge for their tasks.\n\nWinston thanked Paul, confirming his appointment for a shave the next day, and retreated under the gaze of the man's cold, money-grubbing eyes. Intentions masked under the facade of a simple barber, tired of his failing shop, tired of life's less-charitable hands, and potentially desperate enough to resort to the unthinkable. His mounting debts with the loan sharks were no secret, after all.\n\nOn the way back to his office, Winston made a call, ordering an audit into Faith’s financials. Among her insurance documents, he located the policy Faith had recently taken out - its coverage unusually high. This observation was further perturbed by the paperwork revealing that Paul was listed as the sole beneficiary. \n\nThe reflections of the streetlights illuminated the clues that strewn around Winston’s path like breadcrumbs. A web woven thick with secrecy, desperation, and death. The puzzle was not complete, but the edges were beginning to take shape. Faith's death... Paul's desperation. There was more than met the eye in this grim puzzle.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Clyde\nB.

Mack, the man responsible for the rich interior designs was engrossed in sketching a new collection, his exotic reptile sculptures reflecting his extensive knowledge of reptile anatomy and he was known for keeping up with the latest snake discoveries as part of his hobby. \n\n“You Mack?” Winston asked, catching the man's attention. Mack turned to face the detective, revealing a chiseled face accentuated with some disturbing scars. \n\n\"Mack's who you're chattin' to now.\" His tone was casual but assertive. His posture was confident, but his eyes, they held a disconcerting intensity, like a reptile about to strike. \n\nWinston was about to ask about the intriguing designs, instead, Mack strode across the room to a glass terrarium. He sifted his way through a mess of receipts on the barren desk to pull out a small, clear plastic box. \n\n\"I've a hobby that keeps me distracted from work sometimes. Reptiles... snakes, to be precise. A passion I picked up in college,\" he said. He chuckled a little as he offered some snake food to the terrifying critter, its vibrant colors making one's blood run cold.\n\nOn noticing the detective's curiosity regarding the terrarium and the snake held within, Mack revealed, \"Ah, she's a recent purchase. A gorgeous specimen of venomous elegance,\" a peculiar gleam in Mack's eyes as he stared back at the snake, locked in an uncanny understanding.\n\nWinston's gaze wandered to the vast array of receipts adorning the studio desk, most of them marked for snake food and terrarium equipment. But nothing here attached the man to the scars on his face. Curiosity piqued he attempted to steer the conversation towards the scars.\n\nHowever, Mack's expression immediately hardened, curtly shifting the conversation to something less personal, \"That's not your concern, detective.\" It was evident then; Mack wasn’t one to let others take control of the conversation. \n\nAs the detective prepared to leave, Mack added, “I don't get out much. A lot of work crammed here, keeps me pinned down.\" His eyes darted towards a letter, one discovered amongst a pile of threatening letters. All unmistakably written in Clyde’s handwriting rightly threatening Mack’s sister. \n\n\"Ever deal with Clyde?\" Winston inquired. \"I confronted him about his threats to my sister, and that's when Clyde audaciously admitted to them,\" Mack bravely confessed. He further added that he reported the assault immediately after it happened, one he unfortunately happened to witness.\n\nSuitably intrigued, Winston respectfully excused himself with the promise of returning. He found Mack to be a complex subject, snakes, design, and all. The circumstances around Mack and his relation to Clyde evidently needed a more in-depth look.\n\nWinston rubbed his aching temples as he scrutinized the information sprawled across his desk. It had been a long day, and the recent news of Clyde's death hadn't provided any form of convenience.\n\nHe fixated his attention on his prime suspect, Taylor, the adoptive mother of the victim. Her profession as a snake specialist had always struck him as odd, especially now, in a case involving snake venom. Winston slid the calendar invite across the table. “So, you had a day scheduled with Clyde at his chalet, the day of his... incident? A whole day alone with him according to this...”\n\nTaylor nodded softly, her voice was barely above a whisper. \"Just chance... We always planned mother-son days. He loved that chalet. We spent long periods alone there, just us. But things were different that day... I was... scared.\"\n\n\"In public, Clyde wasn't any easier either. There were numerous events where he would explode in anger, catching the sight of all those around him,\" Winston said, recalling the instances of Clyde's violent outbursts that he had documented from his surveys.\n\nIn the hours Winston spent with Taylor, he noted how she seemed on edge. Her eyes darted around the room, clothing neatly arranged, concealing what he suspected might be the aftermath of several violent confrontations. His suspicion was soon confirmed when he found a stack of hospital records tucked away at Taylor’s home detailing her prior injury treatments.\n\n\"Clyde... He got angry often, and I was always the target,\" Taylor admitted when Winston confronted her with the records. \"He sometimes had violent outbursts in public too, but he was my son. I stayed. I always tried to stay safe. Most of my work is behind the glass. You know, handling snakes only under controlled circumstances. Some are venomous, yes.\"\n\n\"Was Clyde aware of the risks in dealing with venomous snakes?\" Winston pressed on, folding his hands atop the table, leaning in, looking for answers within Taylor's eyes. \n\n\"Of course,\" Taylor replied. \"I've had to explain to him before... How the venom works. Why it's dangerous. Even how it's administered if mishandled... But the fear... Clyde was terrifying.\"\n\nThrough her narrative, Winston realized how comfortable she was around venomous snakes, a fact that only heightened his suspicion. He always found such risky professions unnerving.  \n\nFurther interviews with Clyde's friends confirmed Taylor's account of his violent tendencies. In fact, Clyde had confided his plans of spending the day with his mother at the chalet only to these friends. Other than Taylor, nobody else was seen at the chalet during the time of the incident. \n\nInspecting all the data, Winston realized he'd woven together a vast yet mystifying narrative. He reassured Taylor one final time before exiting. \"Thank you Taylor, I will be in touch.\"\n\nAs he left Taylor's abode, he took one last glance at her. He noticed the fear in her eyes, and he knew, her trauma was far from over.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Mack\nB.

Just on the edge of the stage, among the sparsely placed chairs and costume racks, he noticed a small bottle of bleach. He confirmed with one of the stagehands that it belonged to Gloria, the Choreographer.\n\nHe remembered Gloria once mentioning in passing how dangerous bleach could be if ingested. She also was known to often research on various chemicals for special effects in her choreography sets. A bizarre comment to make about bleach, but in her line of work meticulous hygiene was important. The costumes worn by the dancers were often delicate and required careful cleaning. Gloria was known among the troupe for her attention to the sanitation of their attire.\n\nAs Winston considered this, a light flicked on in the office upstairs, an indication that Gloria was still there. She often held late practices and rehearsals in the office building. And those rehearsals often ran over time. \"A perfectionist,\" Winston mumbled under his breath.\n\nMurray, the victim, had frequently been in the office late at night. Alone. Even secretive at times. Winston remembered spotting Murray meeting behind the stage with members of a rival dance group. Something didn't feel right and he paid more attention.\n\nWinston recollected a heated quarrel between Gloria and Murray. Gloria was upset that Murray had leaked her proprietary choreography to the rival dance troupe. This discovery was devastating for Gloria. Her unique, innovative work was out in the open, her career was taking a steep plunge.\n\nWinston stood up and glanced around once more before moving toward the office stairs. Notably, the rehearsal space had no security cameras - no direct way to monitor or record any unusual activities.\n\nHe found Gloria still hard at work in the office. She looked up and he could see disappointment and frustration etched on her lined face. \"Work hard, but don't work yourself into the ground,\" Winston commented mildly. \n\nGloria smiled ruefully, fingers splayed across scattered scripts and documents, \"In this line of work, detective, there isn't much of a choice\". \n\nHe only nodded in response but inside, Winston felt a swirl of questions rising up. Unseen connections forming and dissipating too quickly to catch. Time to dig a little deeper.\n\nWinston carried a cup of his favorite diner's coffee in his hand as he walked into Murray's office building. From the dusty files sitting on top of a filing cabinet he picked up an incident report dated three years ago. A player had accidentally ingested cleaning fluid during a practice session and had fallen ill. The report confirmed that Chris was the coach at the time of the incident. \n\nStepping to the side, Winston made eye contact with the janitor who was tidying up after the police search. \"Some mess this, huh?\" Winston asked casually. \n\nThe janitor looked up at him, nodding. \"Awful thing,\" he said, \"Murray... poisoned in his office like this, during office hours.\"\n\nWinston nodded, thinking of Chris's coaching duties operating during the same hours. Chris's knowledge of health and wellness was also apparent from the motivational posters in the gym area, an area which happened to include an office for Chris and a cabinet holding various coaching supplies, including cleaning products such as bleach.\n\nBefore he left the building, Winston decided to check the lost and found box at the reception. Among the pile of assorted items, a pair of sunglasses caught his eye. They were Chris's, the receptionist confirmed. \n\nWinston next set out to a nearby park which was a popular spot for office employees and tourists alike. He found an elderly woman sitting on a park bench, who recounted witnessing Chris in the park earlier. The woman, however, had lost sight of him near the water fountain. \n\nPulling out his notebook, Winston jotted down the fact that Chris disappeared from sight near the water fountain. He then went on to speak with a local ice cream seller who confirmed seeing Chris heading into a dense, wooded area within the park. \n\nHeading back to his car, Winston ran into a group of tourists who claimed to have seen Chris earlier. One of them confirmed that they had seen Chris before he disappeared. \n\nAs he drove back to the precinct, Winston digested the day's findings. In addition to his coaching duties, Chris was responsible for equipment and supply maintenance. He usually operated during office hours, was familiar with cleaning products including bleach, and his office was located in the same building as Murray's.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Winston fished the statement reports from his pile of case files, which stated that Kent and Julia were last seen together at the mosque.  Kent had been poisoned with snake venom, a tricky murder weapon to trace. His victim, Kent, was Julia's cousin and had last been seen at the mosque with her before he met his unfortunate fate.\n\nHis next stop was clear. He pulled his coat close against the biting wind and snow. Silicon Valley, estate of one Julia. Inside, he found Julia embroiled in what seemed an exhaustive pile of legal documents. From their exchange, he learned that she was currently tangled up in a knotty lawsuit, where the opposing party had a good deal to gain, financially that is.\n\nStepping into what he could only describe as a mini laboratory, a brave new world peered back at him. Labeled samples cluttered the table, one of which was a snake venom sample. Julia was trained as a herpetologist and her job involved working with venomous snakes, she explained this to Winston while also showing him her work with venomous snakes.\n\nAs they moved past countless terrariums, Winston paused in front of a portrait on the mantel. “That’s Kent,” Julia sighed. “Always the favored one, especially by Grandpa. In his latest will, everything was left to him. The will was initially expected to be in my favor, but, he bypassed me completely,\" Julia said. Her voice turned bitter as she revealed these shocking discoveries about her cousin, Kent.\n\nChanging the topic to something less contentious, she mentioned that both of them used to frequent the same mosque for prayers, the very place where Kent was last seen alive by people, before she added, \"And we were together at the mosque that same day.\" Her tone hardened as she described an altercation with Kent she had had earlier that day at the mosque. The tension was palpable as she revealed her own cousin had been secretly helping the opposition in the ongoing legal battle.\n\nWinston nodded, took a few final notes, and bid his farewell, a gust of wind blowing in with the opening of the front door. His footsteps crunched the snow beneath his boots and the stark contrast of his solitary car in the vast white providence painted an odd yet mystic picture. As he drove off, the silhouette of Julia’s house receded, but the flicker of suspicion stayed kindled in his mind.\n\nWinston sauntered into the buzzing fairgrounds. His worn Panama hat tilted, casting a shadow over his contoured face as he surveyed the spectacle of the annual town fair. Ronald, the man he had come to see, was easy to spot - standing tall in his uniform as security for the event.\n\n\"Ronald?\" Winston called out after weaving through the crowd of cotton-candy eaters and parched parents.\n\nA sharp look from Ronald confirmed his identity.\n\nEver the expert at concealing his hand, Winston lightly grazed the topic. \"I hear you’re pretty experienced with snakes. Handle 'em at the zoo, right? A zoo with quite a variety of venomous snakes, so I've heard.\"\n\nA flicker of pride sparked in Ronald's eyes. \"Yes, that's right. From rattlers to mambas, we have them all. I have the keys to all animal enclosures, even the Venomous Serpent Exhibit.\"\n\n\"Must be quite a job, wrangling all those snakes,\" said Winston. \"Especially with the variety of venomous species you have. They can be lethal with their venom.\"\n\n\"You bet. But it's all about understanding and respect,\" Ronald’s eyes reflected the love for his job.\n\nThat’s when Winston changed tactics. He didn't have the luxury of time; the fair was busy, and he sensed Ronald wouldn't stay guard at his post for long. \n\n\"I need to talk about some documents,\" he said. Before he even finished his sentence, the color drained from Ronald’s face. \"Documents linking you to past misdemeanors. They were found on a man named Kent.\"\n\nThe denial came swift and in violence. \"This is preposterous! That man was maligning me; I did nothing wrong!”\n\nA shrill kiddy ride whirled inches from them, momentarily deafening Winston to anything else Ronald had to say. By the time the wooden cars clattered to a stop, Ronald was sprinting the other way. \n\nHe was no longer at his post, no longer within sight, and no longer within Winston’s reach for further questions. For now. The detective adjusted his hat, scanning the field. Winston knew he had started unraveling traces, but he’d need to tread carefully here on out. Ronald was spooked, and even the deadliest snake wouldn't strike unless cornered.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Ronald\nB.

Frances was found murdered there, her body cold and lifeless. Buster, her faithful Golden Retriever was whining nearby, his normally luminous fur matted and dirty. Winston made a note to have someone pick up the poor dog, and that's when he remembered Jerry, the local birdwatcher, mentioning that he'd seen Meredith near this spot around the time the murder would have occurred.\n\nMeredith... the pet groomer who'd often take walks in these woods for her job. She worked nearby, grooming the pets of the affluent folks who didn't mind living a little closer to nature. Hopefully, she could shed some light on things. \n\nOnce at the grooming shop, Meredith greeted Winston cheerfully. \n\n\"Hey there, detective! How can I help you today?\"\n\n\"Just got a few questions for you, Meredith.\" After a few initial inquiries, so as not to raise alarm, Winston changed his approach. \"Were you by any chance in the rainforest yesterday?\"\n\nMeredith seemed slightly taken aback, but she answered, \"Well, yes, I was. I often go there to observe and study animals, it helps me in my work. Why do you ask?\"\n\nWinston responded with another question, \"Did you notice anything unusual in the rainforest yesterday?\"\n\n\"No, nothing out of the ordinary.\" Meredith's answer was too insincere, too fast. Winston decided not to press it for now.\n\nLooking around the shop, Winston noticed a myriad of dog-related awards and trophies that filled the shelves. One, however, stood out--a first place trophy for a shooting competition.\n\n\"Fancy shooter, are you?\" Winston inquired, pointing at the award. \n\n\"Heh, that's a bit of a surprise, is it not?\" Meredith laughed lightly. \"Yes, I used to go to the range quite often with my hunting club, won a few prizes too. I still keep my shotgun in my house, and sometimes bring it here to the shop. My neighbors have seen it a few times when I take it out to clean.\"\n\nBack in the rainforest, Frances' blackmail pressure seemed to be taking a heavy toll on Meredith, as she confessed it to her friend Sarah a while ago. Frances had apparently found out about Meredith's illicit pet trade, and seemed to have been trying to extort money from her in return for her silence.\n\nThat certainly meant a lot of trouble for Meredith. Winston mulled over these facts as he left the shop. The rainforest seemed awfully quiet, leaving him alone with his thoughts. It's best to let this news simmer and see what Meredith does next. Either way, Winston knew he had more digging to do. This was far from over. He got into his car, the thoughts churning in his analytical mind. As he drove off, the shadows of the rainforest seemed to whisper secrets, secrets he was determined to unravel. He vowed to return.\n\nWinston stood near the cordon tape at the crime scene. Frances, a law enforcement officer, had been working relentlessly to bring down the local gang. According to her case files, Frances' investigations have been troublesome for many, especially those involved in dirty deals with the gang. Ever since she started investigating the intersections between Kinsley's spiritual group and the gang, she had drawn close to exposing the hidden ties and nefarious deals between them.\n\n“In all my years in the force,” Winston said to his partner, \"I've seen some hard characters, but spiritual gurus and gang members tied together?\"\n\nHis partner shrugged, \"What's the world coming to, huh?\"\n\nDays later, Winston met Kinsley, a spiritual guru who had been seen leading his spiritual group in the forest the day Frances was killed. Frances, who had been present in the forest on that day, shared her doubts about Kinsley's practices and friends, including those in the gang. She had even observed the pair of them sequestered away in a corner of the forest, a scene that appeared strange given the circumstances.\n\nWinston leveled a steady gaze at Kinsley, \"So you were here in the forest with Frances on the day she was murdered?\"\n\nKinsley nodded, a serene smile never leaving his face, \"I was guiding my disciples here on the same day.\"\n\nHe went on to add, \"In fact, Frances did join me at one point. With just the two of us, we engaged in a brief yet hearty conversation about life, spirituality, and the power of transformation.\"\n\n\"But you don't use any digital communication platforms for your group, correct?\" Winston asked. It had given him a headache trying to get in contact with Kinsley or gather more information about him.\n\n\"No, Detective, I find it more personal to communicate face-to-face than through screens.\" Kinsley reclined in his chair.\n\n\"And your disciples seem to echo this sentiment.\" Winston continued, \"They said they don't have nor have they seen any of your own social media profiles.\"\n\nKinsley merely smiled, \"We believe in living in the moment, Detective. Our connection is a spiritual one, untouched by the likes of Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.\"\n\n\"As such, you only announce your public events on your website, with no social media pages connected to it?\" Winston pressed.\n\n\"That's the way I prefer it,\" Kinsley was nonchalant, \"Avoids a lot of unnecessary distractions, wouldn't you agree?\"\n\nLooking around the peaceful setting, Winston had to reassess his definition of 'distraction'. What wasn't peaceful though, was Kinsley's openly acknowledged links between his spiritual group and the local gang, which added a disturbing edge to his spiritual pursuits.\n\nWinston found it necessary to probe, \"I do find it peculiar that a spiritual guru like you would publicly acknowledge your group's ties with the local gang. That's... quite interesting.\"\n\nKinsley simply shrugged, \"I have always believed in the power of transformation, Detective. Everyone deserves a chance, don't they?\"\n\nWith that final statement, Kinsley rose from his seat, effectively ending their conversation. The case was beginning to appear murkier than before. Winston knew there were still critical pieces of this puzzle he needed to uncover.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Meredith\nB.

Did she mention this to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, she mentioned it,\" Elizabeth replied, with a measured tone. \"But I thought she realized what she meant to our team here.\"\n\nWinston nodded, making a small note. \"I understand she was the star of the play, and a major reason for tickets in the first place.\"\n\nElizabeth confirmed, looking around, seeming slightly uncomfortable. \"Yes, she was... But it wasn't just that. She was brilliant — an excellent performer. Gonna be tough to fill her shoes.\"\n\nThe detective gestured toward the halberd prop resting conspicuously in a stand nearby. \"I believe this was a prop in your production?\"\n\nElizabeth nodded. \"Yes. It's part of the play, used in some of the combat scenes. We rehearse with it frequently.\"\n\nWinston continued, \"And I presume you supervise these rehearsals? Therefore, you would know where it is stored?\"\n\nElizabeth confirmed, adding, \"It stays right here inside the theatre. I have keys to all the rooms, it's part of my job as a director.\"\n\nAs they continued to discuss the play, Winston noticed Elizabeth's phone sitting next to a half-drunk glass of water. It had a large, sturdy case, and there were water droplets on the case. Elizabeth's assistant entered the conversation momentarily, stating offhand, \"Elizabeth's phone is always a bit damp after her showers, which tend to last for an exceptionally long time.\"\n\nWinston offhandedly asked, \"Do you always take your phone to the shower, Elizabeth?\"\n\nHer reply was simply a shrug, \"Yes, why not? It's got a waterproof case. Might as well use it, and who doesn't like a bit of music while they bathe?\"\n\nWinston simply hummed in response, casually glancing towards the assistant who confirmed, \"I've heard the water running a number of times for the full duration of those long showers. She does take rather long showers, indeed.\"\n\nBack to Elizabeth, Winston moved on, \"I understand you discovered Eleanor was having an affair with your husband?\"\n\nElizabeth hesitated, cleared her throat, before responding, \"Yes... It’s true.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me anything about your confrontation?\"\n\nGritting her teeth, Elizabeth admitted, \"She was cruel — she even mocked me. Called me a joke.\"\n\nWinston closed his notebook after jotting down the last statement and gave a curt nod. \"Thank you for your time, Elizabeth.\"\n\nWinston had seen many crime scenes in his day, but Eleanor’s murder was an intriguing case—a wrestling ring and a halberd. Eleanor had been his pal, a local wrestling enthusiast, and her death had shaken him. She had once confided in Winston about Freya's illegal historical artifact transactions, and how she had personally invited Freya to her wrestling match out of concern for her. Freya, who had declared bankruptcy last month, had been loaned money by Eleanor to help fuel her obsession with historical artifacts. Eleanor had been uneasy about this, always threatening to expose Freya if she did not repay her substantial debt. \n\nEleanor's wrestling match, which was held in the public square and coincided with the weekend market, had attracted a large crowd. It was here that Freya had been seen by multiple people. His investigations had led him to the name: Freya, an ex-wife Eleanor once confided about. \n\nMaking his way towards Freya’s dwelling, Winston saw her handling a curious object - a halberd, diligently cleaning and oiling it - a ritual she carried out every fortnight with all the aplomb of someone used to handling these weapons. During their earlier encounters, Freya had spoken about her training in combat with medieval weapons, which had played a role in her fascination for these historical artifacts. As he approached, she didn’t look surprised to see him, even slightly welcoming.\n\n“Are you surprised to see me, Freya?” asked Winston. “After all, it’s not everyday one gets visited by the police at their doorstep.”\n\n“Come on in, Winston,” she responded, shrugging her shoulders. “I was just cleaning my collection. Interested in medieval weapons?”\n\nWinston nodded, eyeing her carefully maintained collection of historical artifacts. He couldn’t help but notice the halberd in her collection that matched the one found at the crime scene. \n\n“You must be getting some good deals on these artifacts, Freya, especially in consideration of your bankruptcy last month.” Winston casually commented.\n\n“We all have our investments, don’t we, Winston? The bankruptcy, it’s all in the past” Freya defensively replied.\n\nBefore leaving, Winston confirmed, “By the way, you do remember Eleanor’s wrestling match in the square, during the weekend market right? The one she invited you to? I recall hearing about some sort of argument that took place shortly before her death.”\n\nFreya froze for a moment and looked at Winston. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Winston. I left the ring immediately after the argument as so many witnessed it. Sure, we had our differences, especially about the money she loaned me and the threats to expose my artifact transactions. But…”\n\nSensing her nervousness, Winston smiled and walked away, leaving Freya to her halberd. With these insightful revelations, tackling this mystery had become a tad bit simpler for Winston. And Freya was certainly playing a prominent character in this plot.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Elizabeth\nB.

Aubrey held the keys to these gates with as much reverence as she held the amber locket around her neck.\n\nEven at the dusk, the gates remained locked until every morning, like clockwork, Aubrey would approach. Her eyes filled with a sense of duty, Winston could see the earnest expression on Aubrey's face as she carefully turned keys in the heavy iron lock, thus breaking the morning lock-up routine.\n\nIn the midst of observing this routine, Winston recalled a conversation he had with a museum associate. Aubrey had indeed gone through a weapon-handling workshop for their historical farming tools exhibit. Among the overlapping news and chatter, the museum's collection of farming tools, including old, rusted sickles, had stood out.\n\nThe garden surrounding Aubrey's museum served as a commendable background for her tea dates with Erika. Erika, as a major stakeholder in the museum, had been more than a frequent visitor. That curious connection kept popping up in Winston's head more often than not.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, Winston observed Aubrey lost in her thoughts. She was walking along the tombstones, meticulously studying and reciting the names engraved upon them. Perhaps it was her way of remembering the past, or maybe just a strange way to unwind.\n\nThere was no one else around, and in the lonesome tranquillity of the graveyard, Aubrey could be seen talking, possibly reciting, to herself. It was a loner's soliloquy, as if she was pouring her secrets over the tombstones just to be buried once again.\n\nWinston could still remember overhearing Aubrey's desperate call for high-interest loans to keep her museum afloat. The economic strain on the museum's budget hadn't escaped Aubrey. His ears rang with her words saying that the repayments on these loans were going to double next month. That, coupled with her responsibility for the acquisition and care of items in the museum's collection, was enough to pressurize any soul.\n\nAs Winston began to tread back towards the unmarked, black investigation car; he noted the quiet cemetery's rusty gates lock again. Every morning, the same routine was played out, the morning locking was now giving way to another day's activities as the wheels started to crunch the gravel beneath, Winston took one last glance towards Aubrey, his suspect and the harbinger of the day's sacred silence.\n\nUnder the intimidating grandeur of the mosque structure, Winston, the detective, sat on a wooden bench, meticulously observing Garry as he was tending the lawn near the west wing. Garry, the only concierge of the mosque, was wiping the brow of his forehead. Beads of sweat flicking off his hand with each move, the masculine, meticulous manner with which he manoeuvered the garden sickle on the greenery, shaped each shrub with an artistic finesse. It was easy to tell he was an old hand with garden tools; his professional grip spoke volumes of his previous life as a farmer. The sickle was a potentially dangerous tool, and Garry's familiarity with it hinted at his past.\n\n\"Hard at work I see,\" Winston observed as he approached the sole handyman. Garry looked up, his eyes narrowing in on the unfamiliar face. \"And who might you be?\" he asked with a hint of caution in his voice. \n\n\"Winston. Detective Winston,\" he introduced himself, tucking the badge away as Garry nodded in understanding. Winston spoke again, \"I believe you were the only staff member on duty during the time of Erika’s murder. I need to chat with you, Garry.\"\n\nErika before, her tragic end, had stumbled upon Garry's criminal records, she expressed her intention to report this to the authorities, making the significance of this conversation unmatched. From the jittery pick-me-up in his darting eyes, it was as though Garry was aware of Erika's intentions and his own past taunting his present.\n\n\"Erika happened to find an unfortunate ending in this room behind me,\" Detective Winston finally broke the silence, pointing in the direction of a closed entrance, \"A room, the keys to which only you have, if I'm not wrong.\" He had leaves no room for doubt about Garry’s exclusive control over those keys.\n\nGarry's attempt to maintain cool was crumbling as the conversation marched ahead straight onto him. \"I just mind my own business, help out the folks around here,\" he defended himself, “The keys to all rooms in the mosque, they are part of my job, not my involvement.”\n\nWinston watched him, not giving away that he knew more than what he was putting into words. As Garry looked away, trying to conceal his anxiety, Winston picked up his hat, excusing himself for the moment. The concierge, the previous criminal, the executor of garden manicuring, the only gatekeeper to Erika’s death room, his presence was crucial to the puzzle surrounding Erika's horrific end. A puzzle that was missing some critical pieces. Anonymously, he decided that he'd be observing a bit more of Mr. Garry and his connection to the late Erika.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Aubrey\nB.

His keen eye caught sight of the security camera footage playing at the front desk – it clearly showed Harry walking into the casino just moments before the tragic murder occurred. He wove his way quickly through the crowd towards his destination – the inner edge of the casino. This secluded corner, often frequented by high rollers, was a crime scene tonight, cordoned off with police tape. Harry, a well-established horse trainer, knew this particular corner all too well.\n\nWinston found Harry standing at the periphery of the scene, alone, seemingly lost in thought. A few onlookers nearby whispered about a heated argument they had witnessed between Harry and Timothy earlier in the night in this very corner.\n\n\"Harry,\" the detective started, as the recognized face turned to meet him, \"Been a while since you've stepped foot in a martial arts tournament, eh?\"\n\nHarry grunted. He wasn't surprised. After all, he was a well-decorated martial arts champion, with several competition victories under his belt. \"In another life, maybe,\" he grumbled. \n\nLiving in the busy business district full of martial arts schools including his own, he had once been a revered martial arts instructor, imparting his knowledge of a specific style – one where the sai was a commonly used weapon – to his students. Daily practice with a sai was part of his routine for years. \n\n\"I heard about your argument with Timothy tonight,\" Winston continued, \"Right here in the corner where our poor victim was found, Harry.\" He gestured towards the cordoned area, then back at Harry. The horse trainer stiffened slightly, but nodded all the same as the reality of questioning sank in. \"I was spotted in the footage, wasn't I?\" he muttered, the deep-seated gambling debt he owed Timothy sketched visible worry lines on his face.\n\n\"As part of our ongoing investigations, we've been checking the security camera footage from the casino,\" Winston explained. \"Interestingly, you're seen entering the place just before the murder.\"\n\nOverhearing their conversation, a staff member chuckled softly before adding, \"He walked in and called John at the front desk, introducing himself as 'Bill'. Then shortly after, he asked Sara, our bartender for a drink, mentioning his name was 'Tom'. Quite the prankster!\"\n\n\"Just a little game I play, Detective,\" Harry said, with a hint of a smile on his face.\n\nThey both looked back at the staff member. He shrugged and gave them a knowing smile, reminding Winston of the gamble-loving spirit he was dealing with — a spirit that left its fingerprints all over the casino's registration documents. \n\nAs Winston walked away from Harry, he pondered on the debt, the aliases, the martial arts background, and the turning wheel of possibilities in his investigation. Indeed, it was going to be a long night at the casino.\n\nWinston rubbed his temples, grappling with the intricacies of this mystifying case. The victim was Timothy, a man of Chinese heritage, which made the crime scene, a luxurious casino, all the more odd. The murder weapon had been identified as a sai, an exotic Asian weapon. He clicked his pen as he checked all the facts and considered the evidence, including the recorded threats indicating a racial bias that Rosemary had once voiced against Timothy.\n\nHis first stop was the buzzing casino kitchen where a woman with a steely gaze ran the show. Rosemary, the head chef, had fifty years of culinary experience and was known for her hardened palm and commanding presence.\n\n\"Detective Winston,\" she began, extending her aged hand in greeting. \"Is this about Timothy?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" replied the detective, accepting her firm hand. \"Tell me, Rosemary, did you leave the kitchen yesterday evening? There seems to be no one who can account for your whereabouts around the time of the murder.\"\n\n\"No, I was here all night,” she stated firmly. “I was busy with dinner service. Ask anyone present, they'll vouch for me.\" The confirmation allowed Winston to check off another fact on his list: no one saw Rosemary leave the kitchen at the time of the murder.\n\nWinston moved past her alibi and onto a subject that intrigued him. \"Rosemary, I understand you have an appreciation for Asian culture and a collection of antique weapons. Is this accurate?\"\n\nWith a brief flash of suspicion, she responded. \"I do, yes. I have sais, katanas, you name it.\"\n\n\"And Timothy, was he dining here last night? At this casino you work at?\" Winston questioned, making sure every fact on his list was thoroughly checked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Rosemary confirmed. \"He was a guest at our private dining area.\"\n\nSo Timothy was dining in the casino at the time of his murder, just as the information had led Winston to believe.\n\nShifting his glance between the various bladed tools in the kitchen and Rosemary, Winston broached the topic that had made local news. \"Rosemary,\" he began, a stern expression on his face, \"there was a public event where you voiced your disdain for Chinese people, any explanation for your behavior?\"\n\nCaught off guard, she fumbled through her words. \"That... that was just a misunderstanding,\" she stuttered, her gaze faltering.\n\n\"Then how do you explain the recorded conversation where you've stated your dislike for Timothy on the grounds of his ethnicity?\" Winston shot back, crossing his arms.\n\nRosemary sighed, her face wrinkling with frustration. \"Sure, Timothy and I didn't get along. We had disagreements during his dinner visit last night...\"\n\nShaking off her nostalgic gaze, Winston pressed on, \"Any threats?”\n\n\"Well,\" she sighed again, \"there were times when I was too angry... I admit threatening him, Detective.”\n\nWinston’s gaze was unbreaking as he finally responded, \"Well, we'll just have to see about that.\" With that, he turned, exiting the hustle of the kitchen behind him.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The day had been anything but a usual one and he reviewed the paper on his clipboard yet again. Kaylee, a young woman, was found dead in an abandoned factory of all places and the purported weapon was a pickaxe, an old miner's pickaxe to be exact.\n\nHis next interview was scheduled with a nanny named Penelope. Penelope was not your average nanny. Alongside her formal education in early child care, she also had professional training in the same field, acquiring skills that allowed her to excel in handling children. Despite her credible qualifications, Winston found it decidedly strange to connect a nanny with such a gruesome find, not least because Penelope herself had most of her busy day spent with children, not in an old factory.\n\nAfter a short walk, he approached a modest suburban home quite close to the abandoned factory. The home itself, despite its proximity, seemed worlds apart from the grim discovery location. \n\nPenelope greeted him at the door, shaking his hand with a warm smile. \"Hello, Penelope.\" Winston greeted, then a thought hit him. A person of her profession is typically responsible for a child's growth and upbringing. Penelope's studied and trained background in childcare had indeed stuck in his mind since their last encounter.\n\nDuring their conversation, Winston learned that Penelope was seen leaving her house around the estimated time of the murder. Interestingly enough, he even had a witness claiming to see Penelope with an old mining pickaxe earlier that day, a claim solidly backed up as the recovered pickaxe, the very same weapon used in the murder, matched exactly the one described by the witness.\n\nJust as he was thinking about the pickaxe, a piece of evidence from the crime scene flashed across his mind. Winston reached into his jacket pocket to pull out a page from a diary. It was from Kaylee's diary. The entry was clear; Kaylee had a meeting scheduled with Penelope at the so-called abandoned factory.\n\nA unease washed over Winston, making the usually delicious coffee taste sour in his mouth. Kaylee seemed to have known something about Penelope that she didn't want public. She had unearthed something about Penelope's past... maybe even criminal past. The parents didn't know... and Kaylee was planning to tell.\n\nHe glanced at Penelope, who was sitting across from him, looking anxious. She must've known that the exposure would cause her serious embarrassment... and at worst, cost her her job. With no other events reported that could have prevented Kaylee from meeting Penelope, it all looped back to the meeting at the factory.\n\n\"Well, Penelope, I do have a long walk back to my car.\" he said, finishing the last of his coffee and standing up. \"I've taken enough of your time, thank you for your cooperation.\" He gave a nod as he reached the door, leaving the nanny to contemplate her day filled with children, and his with unanswered questions.\n\nDetective Winston grimaced, finally setting down the carefully documented police case file of the late Kaylee. The coffee stains on the file folder began to bleed into the corners of the cover. The pangs of guilt for indulging in too much work in the form of an overbrewed cup of joe were not his only concern. An image haunted him; it was from a video footage where Francis had caught Kaylee red-handed, threatening his daughter which he digitally recorded as proof.\n\nShaking the sudden chill from his spine, Winston looked out of his office window to the abandoned factory where Kaylee had been found. Francis, Kaylee's husband, had years of mining experience and was renowned for his pickaxe expertise. Francis had arranged the meeting point and was seen coaxing her into trusting that the factory would be undisturbed.\n\nThe town had all been abuzz with this unthinkable murder. Kaylee's constant torment of Francis' daughter, enough to induce anxiety and depression in the child, was now common knowledge. Even more upsetting was the unusual delicateness Francis had shown in handling this situation, a man known for his work involving grueling physical labor that required a high level of strength and endurance.\n\nDigging into his pocket Winston pulled out the receipt for the pickaxe that he'd found in Francis’ pocket, a peculiar coincidence considering Francis’ mining background and the tool associated with it.\n\nIn the corner of his foul-smelling, second-hand leather bound desk was a photograph. A crisp, clear frame showing Francis purchasing the said pickaxe at the local hardware store. It was not surprising that Francis had chosen to arm himself with a tool he was already so familiar with, but to invite his wife into a murderous trap of his creation was another level of distressing reality.\n\nWinston looked up to see Francis standing in the doorway, tall and solemn. \"Detective Winston,\" he said quietly, \"We need to talk about Kaylee.\"\n\nWinston nodded, gesturing for him to take a seat. \"I heard about what happened. About the threats she made to your daughter.\"\n\nFrancis looked taken aback, his gaze shifting around the room. \"Yes...I caught her threatening our daughter. I don't know why she couldn't see what her actions were doing to our daughter.\"\n\nWinston nodded but said nothing. He stayed silent, letting Francis explain in his own time, about the factory meeting he'd arranged with Kaylee, his knowledge that the factory would have been empty at that time, the purchased pickaxe and the chilling threats Kaylee had aimed towards his daughter.\n\nAs Francis left his office, Winston glanced back at the file, picking up the coffee cup, he pondered the gritty mysteries life tended to serve up.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

She was found dead in a wrestling ring in their hometown. He took a deep breath, steadying his nerves. This case was made more challenging due to the unusual murder weapon: a trident. As he looked over the information he had gathered on Harper and her impressive collection of gladiatorial weapons, he departed his office, heading to the home of the chief suspect.\n\nHarper wasn't a stranger to Isabelle; in fact, they once shared a life as a couple, but that was an extinguished flame now. Harper was now Isabelle's ex-wife. Her name adds intrigue to the investigation exactly due to their previous relationship. Considering their former status, places familiar to Isabelle, like the backstage of the local wrestling tournament they frequented, would not be unfamiliar territory for Harper too.\n\nHis investigation directed him to the site of the wrestling tournament, held in Harper's hometown. Harper, like her former spouse, was a robust woman. She was part of a local Gladiator reenactment group that demanded rigorous physical preparation and conditioning. Isabelle was involved too, but the wrestling was more her specialty compared to Harper's gladiatorial passion. The trident, a weapon from an ancient time, was the weapon of choice amongst Gladiator re-enactors -- meaning, Harper had easy access to similar weapons. \n\nNumerous eyewitness accounts confirmed they saw Harper entering the backstage area on the day of the murder.\n\nIt had been a day of hurried investigation when Winston decided to visit the local Gladiator reenactment group. As he approached, he watched Harper spar intensely with another reenactor, clutching a trident just like the one found near Isabelle's body. When the sparring session ended, he introduced himself.\n\n\"Detective Winston.\" He stretched out his hand, and Harper, wiping the sweat from her forehead, shook it.\n\n\"Harper, right?\" he asked, and she nodded, not particularly off balance by his question but puzzled nonetheless.\n\n\"Yes, what can I do for you, Detective?\" Harper asked, offering a polite smile. She had a significant position in this community; her reputation was one of respect and trust. \n\n\"Just a few questions, Harper,\" Winston promised, his gaze briefly scanning the impressive assortment of gladiatorial weaponry she owned, clearly marking Harper's interest and involvement in the historical fighting.\n\nOn her part, Harper didn't betray any discomfort or restriction. She seemed eager to answer his questions, her commitment to the reenactment group and her schedule also seemed open, her timetable in the city not showing signs that she was bound by any travel limitations during the timeline Winston was interested in.\n\nIt was known that Isabelle threatened to expose a secret, one that involved Harper's dubious dealings. Winston had to tread lightly. This was sensitive information, a notion Harper obviously lived in terror of, as it could damage both her personal and professional life.\n\nSeeing Harper, calculating his next move in this complicated dance, Winston grappled with the elements of this case. The trident, the connection between the former lovers, Harper's affinity for gladiatorial combat, her collection of weaponry, the backstage sighting on the day of the murder, the wrestling tournament held in the city, and the looming threat of a public revelation all tangled together in a mysterious, deadly pattern. Yet, as always, he had to remind himself - a suspect was just that, a suspect. Until proven guilty.\n\nDetective Winston was poring over the pile of paperwork on his desk when a curious document caught his eye - a film production permit, freshly filed by none other than Lance, the director of the ongoing wrestling show.\n\nHe began piecing together the information he'd gathered. As it turns out, Lance had been planning to film at a cabin, located deep within the woods. An off-the-grid location, it was certainly a far cry from the state-of-the-art studios in downtown.\n\nWinston leans back in his chair, giving it a thoughtful swivel. He took a mental break and instead focused his attention on the next round of rehearsals. Recently, someone had reported seeing Lance practicing with a trident. Even for a wrestling show, a trident might have been deemed... unusual.\n\nWhen the rehearsals concluded, Winston took the opportunity to approach Lance. Though not particularly forthcoming, Lance repeatedly referred to Isabelle as his wife while acknowledging his involvement in handling the props, alongside the rest of the crew, and his fondness for studying and collecting ancient weapons.\n\nDuring their slight chit-chat, an unprompted Lance revealed that he had, only yesterday, overheard a troubling conversation between Isabelle and her friend. The words that hit him like a band of drumrolls - Isabelle had decided to divorce him. His desolate eyes echoed the heart-rending shock of the news he had not been prepared for. \n\nAs Winston was making his exit, he caught sight of Lance loading expensive looking filming equipment into a van. The van was parked outside a cabin that seemed to match the setting as described in the script of Lance's upcoming film.\n\nShaking hands with staff and crew, Winston took the opportunity to engage in small talk. Information flowed freely, like a backstage cocktail party, and Winston learned more about the dynamic between Lance and Isabelle.\n\nA crew member mentioned overhearing a conversation between Isabelle and her friend regarding a divorce. Isabelle's bold proclamation still echoed in their ears: she had decided to divorce Lance. This,\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Lance\nB.

Jeremiah, the previous go-kart champion, was found dead at the very track he'd dominated for years. Gary, undefeated and the current champion, had been a massive hurdle for those competing, especially for his rival Jerome, who always seemed to take the second place.\n\nAn eyebrow-raising detail caught Winston's attention, Gary's keys to his office had been reported missing and unaccounted for.  The reports had indicated that a driving instructor by the name of Jerome was the last person to leave Gary's office the day his keys went missing. Winston had also found it strange that Jerome controlled the go-kart track's schedule.\n\nBesides driving instruction, Jerome also seemed to indulge in a martial art form. An impressive certificate of martial arts mastery hung on the walls of his office.\n\nWinston heard rumors of sustained tension between Gary and Jerome. Apparently, they had a history of contentious races, with Gary's supremacy hindering Jerome's chances at first place. Gary had recently accused Jerome of cheating in the last race, leading to a major dispute.\n\nUnusually, a week before the murder, Jerome was seen purchasing multiple sai—a weapon Winston was familiar with from martial arts movies. Some top-drawer receipts from Jerome's office confirmed these purchases. Additionally, he was spotted practicing with the sai at a local gym, following his regular fight moves workout, fueling the mystery.\n\nJerome's passion for go-karting was immense, and as the track's driving instructor, he was deeply involved in all activities. This involvement granted him unrestricted access to most track areas, including Gary's office. \n\nAt the track itself, Winston decided to question Jerome. He found Jerome instructing a group of novice drivers.\n\n\"Jerome?\" asked Winston.\n\n\"That's me,\" replied Jerome, turning around. His gloves showed signs of frequent use. He appeared to be a hands-on instructor.\n\n\"You were close with Gary, I take it?\" \n\n\"He was a tough competitor, but we knew each other on the track,\" said Jerome.\n\n\"His dominance in every race must have been troublesome for you, especially after he accused you of cheating in the last one. The fact that his keys are missing and you were the last person to leave his office must be another troubling circumstance for you.\"\n\nJerome sighed, “It was his word against mine. But yes, it added more tension to our already strained relationship.”\n\nWinston thanked Jerome for his time and decided to dig deeper into this mystery, leaving the sounds of roaring engines and the smell of burning rubber behind.\n\nDetective Winston elegantly stepped out of his car, looking from side to side at the quiet go-kart track. Tire tracks were sketched over the quiet go-kart track. Despite the glaze of the late night, the sight oozed with an unexpected eeriness: the phantom-like go-karts parked neatly, the silent squeal of the rubber tires on the cement track, and the absence of the usual laughter, all seemed abnormal given the facts. It was much later for Frederick, the dock worker, who not only could be spotted at the track frequently, even into the late hours of the previous night, but had been spotted there exceptionally late on the murder day.\n\nConversational whispers echoed among the locals recently. Frederick, it turned out, had been confronting others about their unsolicited interactions with his beloved go-kart. The sight of his kart, now still and silent unlike its usual roar, coupled with the deafening quietness of the night ran chill down Winston's spine. He couldn't shake off the echoes of a recent dispute Frederick had here, not when his racing schedule strangely aligned perfectly with the murder time. And the off hours, serving less crowds, made it an ideal time for Frederick to get some of his responsibilities done, like inventory management and safety checks.\n\nWinston moved towards a small office adjacent to the track. Opening the door, the room was not much larger than a closet with a couple of cabinets, a coat rack, and a table; provisions neatly stacked. Frederick's racing gear - a jacket, helmet, gloves - all graciously set aside on the coat rack, having a faint hint of diesel fuel. Walls adorned with race schedules and a surprising void on the ledge beside the window where a computer likely sat. As a dock worker, Frederick was naturally involved in inventory management and health and safety checks.\n\nHis thoughts drifted to Gary, another regular on the track. Before the silence followed by the sirens, someone had reported seeing Gary fiddling suspiciously with Frederick's kart. The circumstances seemed too cut and dried, further intensified by Frederick's off-hour routine at the track and a suspicious run-in with Gary.\n\n\"Ey, I heard the sirens earlier. Something's happened, ain't it?\" A voice, bearing a question gripped with anxiety, interrupted Winston's thoughts. Turning, the detective found himself face to face with a night security guard.\n\n\"Yes, I'm afraid there's been an incident. You wouldn't have noticed anyone acting strange around Frederick's usual racing time earlier today, would you?\"\n\n\"I don see clearly from the gate, but yeah, there's always something smack peculiar during that hour, \" the guard answered, wiping his brow with a used handkerchief. His statement was an indirect validation of the conspicuous activities during the usual times Frederick would race.\n\nThe night, however quiet, was thick with implications, marred by the footprint of a crime at a go-kart track.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The high profile murder of Jamal had the community on edge. \n\nA commotion caught his attention as a man named Gerald was directed towards him; a towering figure, with shaky hands that contradicted his hard-set eyes.\n\n\"Are you Winston?\" Gerald's voice was soft as he extended his hand to the detective. \n\n\"Indeed,\" Winston replied, examining the intricate movement of Gerald's fingers as he played with his jacket. \"Play an instrument?\"\n\n\"Aw, already caught me out, did you?\" Gerald laughed. \"I play the violin. Lot of class and vitality in a violin.\"\n\n\"Must have steady hands for something like that\" Winston noted. The thought of handling a violin, and a shotgun, involved a high level of similar dexterity.\n\nOn Gerald's way out, Winston caught the surveillance monitor playing a video taken earlier that day. It was Gerald, entering the mosque just as the midday prayers were set to commence. This was a ritualistic routine for Gerald, arriving before the midday prayers began and always praying fervently during that time; the same time the murder happened, Detective Winston had learned during the investigation.\n\nWinston decided to mingle with the on-goers, to see what he could gather. A local community meeting was in action, and he discovered an old friend of Gerald's named Arnold. Arnold mentioned that Gerald had openly discussed his fear of Jamal's charisma in front of the entire community during a meeting, and how he, Gerald, feels inferior to such captivating influence. Gerald's deep involvement within the mosque's day-to-day activities seemed unquestioned, even though he was openly scared of Jamal's charismatic hold on the people. \n\nListening further, Winston discovered that Gerald was well-respected amongst the community, and was legally allowed to purchase firearms due to having a clean record.\n\nMeeting Gerald again for a one-on-one, Arnold was present, making the interaction more personal. Gerald admitted to them both about his feelings of inferiority to Jamal's vast influence. \n\n\"Gerald,\" Winston asked, \"A week before Jamal was murdered, where were you?\"\n\nGerald swallowed, \"Well, I was out purchasing a new shotgun. Why?\"\n\nWinston simply nodded and said, \"Just collecting the facts. That's all.\" \n\nHe ended the conversation soon after that, wanting to get back to the office to review the evidence. As Winston watched Gerald walk away, his mind replayed their conversation. An undercurrent of fear seemed to wash over Gerald whenever Jamal's name was mentioned. But that was all facts. Nothing more.\n\nWinston was at the crime scene, a deserted mosque, when he received news that a suspect had been identified. Mark, a local lawyer, reputed for representing law enforcement personnel was due to be interviewed. His résumé was diverse and impressive, having in several cases represented law enforcement personnel from whom he obtained extensive knowledge about firearms. As a lawyer, Mark was often called upon to play a vital role in ensuring the safety and well-being of his community while protecting the law enforcement personnel who kept it safe. Despite the sacred surroundings, a chill ran through Winston. \n\nMark's office was filled with a faint scent of cologne and smoke. A number of law enforcement badges and hats met Winston's sight. \"I have worked with a lot of your kind,\" responded Mark when asked about the artifacts. \n\nWinston then asked Mark if he had any known meetings today. Mark responded, \"Yes, it was a standard law firm meeting with my colleagues.\" He paused for a moment before adding, \"You know how it goes, lots of talk. And if participants thought I was repeating lines from true crime documentaries, they were right – I sometimes do it to make my point.\"\n\nThe conversation drifted to hobbies. Mark mentioned that he enjoyed watching true crime documentaries late into the night. He mentioned that the complex structures of these crimes and the chase to find answers gave him a thrill. \"Makes me relive my cases without actually being involved. In fact, I'm constantly quoting lines from one of these during my meetings,\" he chuckled. \"My neighbour probably knows about this too. He once told me he noticed my TV on late into the night.\"\n\nOne interesting fact Winston discovered was that Mark had successfully handled cases involving firearm charges. He asked Mark about this. \"That's part of my job, after all,\" Mark replied. \"Dealing with such cases is a part of ensuring the safety of this community.\"\n\nThe subject of firearms led Winston to ask if Mark had purchased any ammunition recently. With a raised eyebrow, Mark replied, \"You're right. I did buy a couple of boxes of shotgun shells from the local store. Just wanted to know more about it from a personal perspective. The clerk even confirmed my purchase,\" he shrugged. \n\nSeeing no point in beating around the bush, Winston then asked Mark about Jamal. There was momentarily a flicker of fear that flashed across Mark's face before he turned stoic again. Mark confessed he had interacted with Jamal on a few occasions where community members expressed concerns about Jamal's extremist ideas to him. These ideas had scared him. He had confessed to a friend about his fears and it looked like a nightmare coming true.\n\n\"There's a thin line between ideas and action, detective,\" Mark's voice was barely above a whisper, \"Unfortunately, some people don't realize it until it's too late\".\n\nAs Mark was sending Winston out, he whispered, \"And between you and me, it freaks my neighbor out. The only thing he says he can hear is the distinct audio from my late-night true crime documentaries.\"\n\nWinston left the law firm office with a weary sigh. He knew he had a long night ahead of him, fishing for answers, following leads, exhausting every possibility until he could bring justice to Jamal.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

He finally allowed himself a sigh, memories of his recent argument with Isabella echoing in his mind. It was in that argument she had threatened to go to the police with Russell's secrets. Picking up his hat from the rack, he fastened it low on his brow before stepping out onto the streets. It was time to meet Russell.\n\nRussell's colleagues had mentioned seeing his car fully loaded earlier when he was leaving. Russell had animatedly talked with them about his big shopping for the trip. Winston’s rendezvous took him to a quaint little house tucked away down the street. As he pulled up, he could indeed see the station wagon parked outside, already loaded up for a trip. As he approached Russell, who was furiously packing more supplies into the car - products of his extensive shopping, he noted, Winston called out.\n\n\"Russell?\" Winston inquired.\n\n\"Detective,\" Russell acknowledged him, distress etching his features. Russell had seemed similarly distressed after their argument over Isabella, a thin man, with spectacles which gave an almost scholarly texture to his otherwise weary face.\n\n\"Seems you're setting up for a long journey\" Winston gestured towards the packed car, recalling what his colleagues had told him, \"Three weeks of no work, off to a camping trip, I've heard.\"\n\nRussell paused, nodding his head in agreement, \"Yes, I am. And I’m aware the campground will be out of cell service for the entire three weeks but I just need some time alone.\"\n\nWinston could recall Isabella's threats during their heated argument before her untimely death. She had expressed concern about Russell's exotic interests and had even threatened to reveal Russell's secrets, potentially to the police.\n\n\"Mighty fine creatures you got here\" Winston pointed to the cage of poison-arrow frogs, his piercing gaze fixed at Russell. \"I've heard they pack quite a punch. Isabella mentioned something about you researching how to extract poison from them?\"\n\nRussell stuttered, his eyes darting away nervously, \"Yes... uh... I... I have learned from my past mistakes, shared some with Isabella... But, I... I have been researching about poison... you know, for my poetry...\"\n\n\"The diversity this world offers, there's nothing like it, detective,\" Russell replied as if finding his footing again, \"Plenty of inspiration for my work during my extensive travels... And a few rare species for my collection too.\"\n\nAs Winston took his leave, he reiterated, \"I see you're off to a pretty isolated campsite. Remember, the constant peace comes at the cost of no cell service for the entirety of the trip.\"\n\nRussell accompanied the detective out, his face looking slightly more worn, \"Yes, I am prepared... just need some time alone.\"\n\nVexation etched across Winston’s face. The puzzling connection between Russell and Isabella's death only grew stronger with every passing moment.\n\nThe scent of sterilization filled his airways as Winston walked into the buzzing tattoo parlor. The hum of the tattoo gun was constant and hypnotic, his eyes drawn to the swarming rainbow of ink bottles across the counter - Travis's impressive collection of exotic animal-based inks. One bottle stood out in particular to Winston, a cloudy toxin from a poison dart frog - Travis's signature choice. \n\n\"Quite an unusual choice of ink,\" Winston noted, garnering a shrug from Travis, the famous tattooist known for using such exotic substances.\n\n\"Delivers a unique color tone\" Travis replied with a nonchalant air. \n\nDetective Winston glanced over at the meticulously drawn out labyrinth on the parlor's wall, an intricacy of lines and curves. \n\nNoticing his gaze, Travis stated proudly, \"I helped build that masterpiece, used to wander around in it during construction, you know. I always make sure to go whenever it's open and am either seen entering or leaving it with Isabella.\"\n\nA factoid which piqued Detective Winston's interest. \"Quite the sightseeing, I suppose.\" \n\n\"Quite.\" Travis retorted, cleaning his workstation in preparation for the next client.\n\nThe parlor was indeed quieter than usual, he noted, only a couple of dedicated patrons waiting their turn. \n\n\"Business been slow lately, Travis?\" Winston asked, eyeing the worrying lack of customers in the parlor.\n\nTravis shot a glance at him and put his tattoo machine down, \"That nosy lady Isabella, she was digging too deep into my affairs, even had the guts to expose some illegal activities\" Travis sighed harshly, \"Gave my shop a bad rep among straightlaced customers.\"\n\nWinston’s brow arched at the mention of Isabella's name. Travis continued to pack away his ink vials, \"She was revealing stuff about those 'activities' that put my reputation on the line.\" \n\nNot wanting her to dig up more dirty secrets, Travis spoke more cautiously. \"If it wasn't for her, you wouldn't see me here.\"\n\n\"But here you are, and where was you the day Isabella met her unfortunate end, Travis?\"\n\n\"The labyrinth...I was there most of the day, nobody else but me,\" Travis admitted, going back to his work on his next client. \"And Isabella was there too.\"\n\n\"That day...were you close to her, by any chance?\" Detective Winston asked, trying his best to mask his tone of curiosity.\n\n\"You could say that,\" Travis replied, \"We were pretty much the only ones around.\"\n\nWinston thanked Travis for his time and left, the hum of the tattoo gun, fueled by exotic animal inks, echoing behind him as he headed towards the labyrinth, feeling as if he were descending deeper and deeper into a mystery.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Jacqueline, a big fan of a certain singer, Veronica, was his latest case, a priority due to the unusual circumstances surrounding her death - snake venom, of all things, at a laser tag arena concert, no less. A concert that shockingly happened to be on the very day of her murder.\n\nA flier of Veronica's concert caught his eye, purple lasers splashed across the front. It had been widely promoted online - Veronica herself had announced it on her social media accounts. \n\nVeronica's social media had been a hotbed of activity ever since she had publicly insulted Jacqueline's nationality during a recent performance, causing several heated public altercations both online and at the arena due to this prejudice. It caused quite the stir on the internet.\n\nRemembering the online fuss, Winston did some digging and arranged a meeting with Veronica via her manager. \n\n\"Hello Detective, how can I help you?\", Veronica asked. Her songwriter's pen was twirling between her fingers absentmindedly.\n\n\"I'm on the Jacqueline case\", Winston answered stoically.\n\nA flicker of emotion crossed Veronica's face, \"I remember her...We had an argument at a party...about our nationalities.\" She avoided Winston's gaze.\n\n\"Hmm, those racial tensions caused quite a frenzy both at your shows and on social media. Is that correct?\" Winston pointedly asked. Veronica’s mouth twisted, but she said nothing.\n\nWinston changed course, \"You used to work at a snake farm, isn't that right?\"\n\n\"Yes,” Veronica replied nervously. “It was indeed, and would you imagine the irony, where I performed a week before Jacqueline's murder. They called later saying some venomous snake was missing.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" muttered Winston. \"You also penned a research paper about snake venoms, is that right?\"\n\nVeronica looked genuinely surprised, \"Yes, how did you know?\"\n\n\"I find it important to know about people I'm investigating. I also know that Jacqueline was a big fan of your music.\"\n\nWith that, he wrapped up the interview, leaving Veronica a little perplexed. Back at the precinct, he sifted through the scattered notes and typed up his report. Nothing was solved yet, but the pieces were moving into their respective slots.\n\nDetective Winston flipped through the dossier. The laser tag arena was usually a place of fun, but now it was marked by tragedy -- Jacqueline's death. Abigail was the last person in the room with Jacqueline. She had been there volunteering for a charity event, with Jacqueline's team participating in the event. The severity of the situation felt at odds with the colorful neon lights illuminating the fluorescent walls and synthetic turf. \n\nHe walked into the arena, noting the silence that hung in the air. He recalled the fact that the owner could hardly give him any insight given that he was preoccupied at his convenience store during the night shift. Winston checked the store's transaction records, Abigail had indeed been here in the laser tag arena, her payment indicated her presence. Abigail had also been involved with the reptile exhibit at the local zoo; he was also informed of a recently attended seminar on venom extraction. That little detail felt oddly chilling in the context of the events. \n\nAbigail's neighbor, when questioned, told him about his nocturnal TV watching pastime. His enjoyment of late-night soap operas inadvertently gave him a clear view of her door, consistently noting Abigail's comings and goings, her odd hours, and her solitary existence. \n\nHe took a trip down to the zoo. It was awash with excited children and worn-out parents. A small sign heralded the reptile house as of particular interest, with potent venom snakes prolifically cited. A zookeeper mentioned a few offhanded comments Abigail had made about how venom extraction wasn't so difficult, it gave Winston pause. \n\nAs he left, the shocking reality hit him - notably one fact, no one else had entered the laser tag room at the time of the event. Abigail and Jacqueline were the only two in the room. There was still more to be done, more evidence to be collected.\n\n\"Where were you when Jacqueline was bitten by a snake, Abigail?\" He asked in his careful detective's tone. Abigail laughed nervously, her eyes darted around before landing on him again.\n\n\"I've told you, I was in the main lobby.\" She replied, folding her arms protectively over her chest. \"Look, detective, I work at a zoo. The reptiles are my job, not some kind of hobby, okay?\" \n\nThey had wrapped up their conversation, and he was left with some threads of information that were yet to be woven into a full picture. It was time to follow the clues, to unravel the tightly woven mystery around the tragic end of Jacqueline.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Abigail\nB.

When you see something new, you remember it, he mused.\n\nThe town had been buzzing since Ervin's angry outburst in the synagogue last Sunday. Bystanders had recounted to Winston how Ervin had been shouting at a particular customer he had been consulting with, before the outburst escalated and he stormed off into the synagogue. The same customer Walter Harrison was who Ervin had consulted with before he stormed off into the synagogue, had recounted it to him with fear in his voice.\n\n\"And you say you were trembling after the confrontation, Mr. Harrison?\" Winston asked after the customer finished recounting Ervin's worrying reaction.\n\n\"N-not just a confrontation,\" the distressed customer stammered, \"Ervin, our Rabbi, he lost it – punching the walls, shouting at everyone. There’s still a visible dent where he hit.\"\n\nWinston gave a slight nod, “Thank you for your cooperation,” he said before heading toward the synagogue to track down Rabbi Ervin.\n\nErvin Thornberg, the Rabbi, met Winston's inquiring gaze coolly. Ervin had a hardened look - the clear evidence of his military past. He was known in town as former military officer with specialized training in demolitions. Nothing could erase that part of his life.\n\n\"Quite an impressive array of memorabilia here, Rabbi,\" Winston remarked, scanning the room filled with various wartime relics like grenades and medals from Ervin's service days. \"Your friends often tell stories of you proudly showing these off.\"\n\n\"Careful with those, Detective, they are from my time in the service,\" Ervin replied, with a hint of nostalgia creeping into his tone. \"My friends, they have a way of making things sound more dramatic.\"\n\nWinston was further intrigued by the hint of gossip he received from one of Ervin's neighbors, \"You know, Otis had been vocal lately. He saw something he shouldn't about Ervin and the synagogue funds. Even said he was planning to go to the authorities.\"\n\nWith that information, Winston pitched it to Ervin, \"I hear Otis saw something alarming involving you and the synagogue's funds. Heard he was seriously considering going to the authorities.\"\n\nErvin stiffened noticeably, his cool gaze flickered for a moment. \"Otis talks too much,\" he muttered, a subtle hint of annoyance in his tone.\n\nJust as he was about to leave, a troubling fact popped back into his mind - Otis. Otis had seen Ervin embezzling funds from the Synagogue and Ervin knew that. Winston marked it down mentally and with a brisk nod to Rabbi Ervin, made his exit. Feeling the sharp gaze of Ervin boring into his back, he needed no further confirmation.\n\nThe pieces were neatly aligning, like pieces of a puzzle, Winston could see it - But it wasn't his place to tell the story, rather gather it. So with another sigh, he slid into the driver's seat and drove off. The knot in his gut tightened as he pulled away from the synagogue - he knew his work here was far from done.\n\nWinston pulled the collar of his jacket up and stepped into the freezing cold of the hockey rink. Alone in the rink, he squinted under the heat of the artificial light to read the deserted stands and make out the chalk lines: \"Just a man and his routine...Otis was always here at this time, when no one else was present...So why Otis? Why here?\"\n\nHours later, Winston found himself wading through the mud and foliage of a nearby hiking trail. He was there to meet Andrew, the local hiking guide, a formally trained Bomb Disposal Technician in the military, and a close friend of Otis. Andrew's hiking business had been losing traction for quite some time. His soldier-like formality was still intact, standing tall despite the fall of his flailing business, which was evident through alarming financial reports showing consistent and increasing negative balance in his accounts.\n\n\"Right this way, detective.\" Andrew offered, leading him through the dense woods with the authority and precision that only a man with his specialized training would possess. Andrew diligently used his army skills to ensure the safety of hikers from any potential environmental dangers on their guided tours.\n\n\"Andrew-\" Winston began, striding to keep up with the trained speedwalker, \"I was told you two were close. And you had asked Otis about his insurance policy recently. Care to shed some light on that?\"\n\nAndrew did not look back as he continued walking. \"Sure did. Otis had been open about his routine. I always knew when he was at the rink or off somewhere else. As for his insurance, he had approached me for advice and later updated it, naming me the beneficiary.\"\n\nAs they neared Andrew's hiking spot, Winston noticed a military-grade tent with tools, knives, ropes, canned food supplies, and hidden among them, explosives. Andrew's intense secrecy hinted at something more - these were not just regular hiking supplies.\n\n\"Quite a collection here, Andrew. Comes in handy during your hikes I presume?\" Winston asked casually. Andrew replied with a nod, \"It's an efficient system. Every item serves a purpose.\"\n\nBefore Winston could probe further, his phone buzzed, indicating a call from the station. \"Just bear with me, Andrew,\" Winston excused himself. Andrew shuffled uncomfortably nearby, sparked a further conversation about Otis' recent insurance update.\n\nA forensic update from the station linked the lethal grenade to the recent military base theft!\n\n\"Do you mind if we take this conversation downtown, Andrew?\" Winston turned around. Andrew stood tall, showing no signs of discomfort. He simply nodded and followed Winston, all the while maintaining his usual formal demeanor.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Ervin\nB.

The murder of Jimmy had taken him by surprise; the wealthy hotelier owned multiple hotels worldwide and was known for his love of high-end luxury, a stark contrast to the modest locale where he met his untimely demise.\n\nSlipping the photographs back into their manila envelope, Winston set his sights on his main person of interest, a guitarist named Randy. Not only was he seen at the motel the exact day Jimmy was killed, he was also seen entering Jimmy's room, a fact uncovered from an interrogation of motel guests as there were no CCTV cameras to corroborate their claims. Their room keys weren’t distinctly marked either, allowing anyone to access any room if they possessed a similar key.\n\nRandy, known in circles for his habitual participation in poker games, had gambled away his income putting him in a tough spot financially. The man was drowning in debt, unable to pay off his loans and this murder could potentially be tied to his monetary problems.\n\nWinston stepped into a local dive bar where Randy was performing. His exceptional dexterity, as he played the guitar, was quite noticeable. A guitarist's finger agility and coordination would be beneficial to a shooter.\n\nHaving seen Randy perform a few solos, Winston made his move, \"Mind if I join you, Randy?\" Winston asked, sliding into the bar seat next to the musician. \"Of course, officer. What can I play for you?\" Randy asked, strumming a slow, bluesy riff.\n\n\"Actually, what I need isn't a song,\" Winston said, leaning in a little closer. \"A few folks saw you at Jimmy's room at the motel and you were also spotted with a revolver at a concert last month. Anything you'd like to share?\"\n\nRandy strummed his guitar a beat longer before halting, looking away before returning his gaze to Winston. \"Yeah, I knew Jimmy.\" He confirmed. \"We've crossed paths a few times.\"\n\n\"You frequent the shooting range around here much?\" Winston probed further, sensing a shift in Randy's demeanor. \"Yeah, I do. I like to shoot around, helps clear my head.\"\n\n\"And that revolver, the same you flaunted at the concert last month... was that the one you used at the target range?\" Further probing, Winston felt Randy's guard starting to falter.\n\n \"That's the one. But what does this have to do with Jimmy? I heard he was killed with a revolver.\"\n\n\"On the nose, Randy.\" Winston's words were void of emotion. \"Ballistics confirmed the revolver used to kill Jimmy was identical to yours.\"\n\nSeemingly cornered, Randy retorted with a bitter remark; \"Every revolver around here looks like that.\" \n\nWith empathy lacing his voice, Winston closed, \"Well if you need any help with those looming loan repayments, I'd be more than happy to point you towards the right resources.\" \n\nWith that, Winston left Randy pondering at the bar, lost in his thoughts.\n\nWinston was a beer and steak, sawdust and power-tools kind of man. He wasn't familiar with this world of protein shakes, barbells, and sweaty gym enthusiasts. Yet, here he was, investigating a case that led him to a gym, talking to a woman named Isla.\n\nIsla. A lean woman with lightened hair that fell to her shoulders. She looked like the typical sort to blend into this gym environment, but there was something different about her. Not in an obvious sort of way, more like an exception you'd find in an otherwise uniform crowd, hidden at first glance.\n\nShe was talking to her friend nearby, her face wrought with concern and frustration. As Winston inched closer, he overheard her whispering, \"I can't bear it anymore, Jess...this blackmail from Jimmy....\" \n\n\"Hi, sorry for interrupting. I'm Winston, a detective. Just a few questions, if you don't mind?\" said Winston, taking out his notepad and pen. He watched as Isla swallowed hard and nodded, adjusting the straps of a gym bag which seemed heavier than it should be.\n\n\"Been here long?\" Winston started, attempting a casual tone.\n\n\"Most of my days may as well start and end here,\" Isla ironically chuckled, wiping the sweat from her brow. That’s when Winston noticed the book falling out of her gym bag. 'Forensics for Dummies', it read. A few other gym attendees nearby gawked at it, mouths gaping, one of them mentioning, \"Isn't that the book she's always rambling about? I swear she keeps discussing trace evidence and bullet trajectories while doing her cardio.\"\n\n\"Interesting read there,\" Winston gestured towards the book. Isla looked at him hesitantly before nodding, \"I'm trying to...get some control over my situation,\" she admitted, indirectly revealing her desperation to stop the blackmail.\n\nHe decided to ask her about Jimmy, watching as her eyes showed a flash of fear, \"I heard you and Jimmy were quite close,\" he continued, keeping his tone casual, non-accusatory.\n\nIsla appeared defensive, \"We've met up a few times. At the motel downtown,\" she added hurriedly as if she wanted to get it out there before Winston asked.\n\n\"The evening Jimmy died, by any chance were you at the motel?\" Winston asked her. He watched her closely as she looked at him, confirming without uttering a word.\n\n\"Anyone to vouch for you?\" he continued. She hesitated, \"No... No, I was alone,\" she confessed quietly.\n\n\"Motive is often a strong feeling,\" he said, almost to himself more than to her. \"Jimmy was blackmailing you, wasn't he? Threatened to expose some photos?\"\n\nHis question seemed to visibly shake her, \"Yes...those photos...he threatened...,\" she trailed off, looking even more upset than when Winston first laid his eyes on her. The room filled with the noise of clanking weights and blaring music, but Isla and Winston sat in their own wall of silence.\n\n\"Alright,\" Winston concluded, not pressing her any further. \"Take care of yourself, Isla,\" he said before walking away. He had learned enough for the day. Now, the puzzle of Jimmy's death was waiting to be solved. Even if gym visits were not Winston's preference, he was willing to solve the mystery.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Isla\nB.

The place had a distinct, chilling atmosphere today, the murder of Marvin casting a grim shadow over it.\n\nHe spotted Justin not too far away, watching the game with a fixed expression. Justin had been noticeably depressed since a particular event - he had once proposed to Marvin's fiancé, expressing his undying love, only to be mercilessly rejected. After this incident, he was never quite the same, living with a constant air of despair and refusal to engage with happiness.\n\n\"Justin,\" Winston called out, making his way over. As soon as Justin heard the detective's approach and caught sight of the man in uniform, his eyes instantly lit up, always eager to gain more information about the crime.\n\n\"Detective,\" Justin greeted, his expression somber, yet subtly eager, \"here for the game or here about the recent crime?\"\n\nWinston raised a brow. Justin seemed too interested. \"Any hockey fan would be here for the game,\" he replied, \"Marvin was going to play, wasn't he?\"\n\nJustin's dry eyes took on a spark when the murder was mentioned again. He looked dejected at the mention of Marvin, but nodded, \"Yeah, he was. I was here to watch it.\" He had been with the crowd entering the hockey rink at the time of the murder, ready for the game and totally unprepared for the tragedy that eventually unfolded.\n\nHe paused, glancing around the rink, then asked, \"Do you know how they got in? The murderer, I mean.\"\n\nWinston kept his expression unreadable, but he noted Justin's quick change of topic back to the crime. \"Through the main entrance,\" he stated simply, \"like anyone else,\" he added, reaffirming that Justin had entered the same way.\n\n\"And the time... when exactly did it happen?\" Justin changed the topic right back to the crime again, the flame in his eyes burning brighter at the prospect of new details.\n\nWinston frowned slightly, \"During the game,\" he answered, watching Justin's face carefully. He appeared unphased.\n\nJustin cocked a brow, excitement mixed with intrigue evident in his lit eyes. \"I was here during that time,\" he pointed out, \"Watching the game.\"\n\nWinston nodded, \"You were, and as far as anyone knows, you didn't leave until well after,\" he almost sighed, \"Listen Justin, what exactly is it with you and this crime? It seems that you're more interested in it than the hockey game.\"\n\nJustin shifted, looking anywhere but at him, \"Well, it's just...Marvin and his fiancé, you know. I just thought they...weren't right for each other. I had a talk with her once. I asked her not to marry him. But she didn't listen.\"\n\nA sudden clang of a puck hitting the net caught their attention, but Winston kept his gaze on Justin, watching, and listening. There was a lot more to this case than meets the eye, he knew. However, his interview with Justin had just ended, leaving him with more questions than answers.\n\nThe harsh, industrial lighting of the hockey rink painted a grave picture as Detective Winston surveyed the crime scene. The rink's security tapes corroborated Frederick's presence at the scene, even capturing a heated argument between him and Marvin. In this particular argument, Marvin was heard threatening harm to Frederick's defenceless daughter. Frederick, a curator of a local weapons museum, also held a job at the hockey rink, giving him a valid reason for being there.\n\nSetting that evidence aside, Winston trotted towards the museum, a place Frederick frequented due to his love for antique machetes. Frederick had the responsibility of overseeing the unique collection of blades, his dedication emanating as bright as the lights above the collection.\n\nWhat piqued Winston's interest though was that one of the machetes in Frederick's collection matched the description of the weapon that ended Marvin's life. Such violent usage of a machete aligned with Marvin's previous harmful behavior; aggressive threats and unbidden visits to the girls' locker room only added to the growing list of his offensive conduct. After obtaining the necessary legal papers, Winston re-examined the machetes, concluding the lethal weapon indeed came from Frederick's collection.\n\nTaking a break from the museum, Detective Winston investigated Frederick further by questioning those who knew him. His protective behavior for his daughter was a common topic, supported further by a chilling detail given by a coworker in the hockey rink's locker rooms.\n\n\"Marvin once threatened Frederick's girl. Frederick didn't take it lightly, and they've been arguing ever since,\" the coworker confessed. Despite the locker rooms being an area exclusively accessed by staff with keys, Marvin had been spotted in there more times than anyone could count.\n\nWinston's sharp gasp caught the coworkers attention, \"What is it, Detective?\"\n\n\"Nothing...just...let me know if you notice anything else...odd,\" replied Winston.\n\nEchoes off the old lockers were the only responses he got.\n\nWith a cluttered mind flooded with information, Winston had a lot of thinking to do, miles to go before this case could be put to rest.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Bad news was often paired with a country farm, but today was particularly grave - A death at the chalet, a bear trap, and a farmer named Gordon.\n\nWinston slowly climbed out of the car as he neared the farmhouse - a large wooden structure isolated in the distant country land, adjacent to a somber cemetery. The only cemetery in town, he thought. Isolated, just like Gordon, its only neighbor who immigrated here with no known family. Gordon had landed there, growing crops, breeding animals, keeping up a farm.\n\nHe walked up the pathway onto the farm, noticing the creaking wooden sign that read 'Gordon's Hunting Supplies'. It was evident that Gordon was more than just a standard farmer. The sign was riddled with buckshot. 'Bear problems,' Winston thought to himself as he made his way to the front door. \n\nGordon was sitting on a rickety wooden stool as Winston made his approach. He was weathered from years of outdoor work and his eyes carried an unmistakable lonesome pain. His fists were gripped around a wooden handle, tapping rhythmically onto the dry farm soil. He was tense.\n\n\"Gordon?\" Winston quietly asked. The man nodded in response keeping his gaze fixed intently on the horizons towards the cemetery. \n\nHaving heard about Gordon's regular evening walks towards the cemetery, Winston tried to carefully navigate the conversation towards Harry. \n\n\"Heard you folks had quite a fuss at the farmer's market recently?\" The old farmer barely reacted, still lost in his world. \n\n\"Took away your best customer, did he?\" added Winston, trying to draw Gordon out. He was referring to the fact that their recent altercation was born out of Harry winning an award for his agricultural products - a feat that Gordon declared was a result of favoritism and had led to his sales dropping.\n\nMinutes of silence passed before Gordon finally spoke haltingly, \"Harry cost me my sales, my livelihood... Those people chose his products over mine.\"\n\nThen, as if realizing he'd said too much, Gordon hastily added, \"But that's all he took. I got no hard feelings.”\n\nWinston carefully listened but made no attempt to comfort Gordon or press the matter further. He took one final look at the brooding farmer, jotting down the conversation in his notepad.\n\nLeaving the stoic and isolated farmer behind, Winston walked back to his car, the image of Gordon gazing over his desolate farm, framed by the town cemetery slowly fading away in the rearview mirror. His evening walk later would follow the usual path towards the cemetery. Gordon might be an immigrant here, but the cemetery and the isolation made him a local... and a person of interest.\n\nWinston stood by the window in the chalet, gazing at the dense forest that surrounded the remote building. The last golden rays of the setting sun were piercing through the firs, illuminating the disturbingly peaceful crime scene where Harry met his end.\n\n\"Winston.\" His name was uttered by a bulky figure standing at the edge of the woods. He turned to see Dexter approaching him, his hulking silhouette cast in shadows by the setting sun.\n\n\"Evening.\" Winston greeted. \"You're Dexter, right?\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Dexter responded, a friendly smile replacing his creased frown. \"I'm guessing you're here about Harry.\"\n\n\"We'll have to speak about that.\" Winston confessed. \"Did you often hunt around these parts?\"\n\n\"Every chance I get.\" Dexter nodded, glancing back at the woods. \"The owner and I... we're close, see. Been hunting together for years. Learned a lot about traps and hunting methods in that time. He's generous too, lets me use the chalet pretty often.\"\n\n\"This a bear trap?\" Winston gestured to the congealing pool of blood around the sprung trap. \n\n\"Yeah, standard issue for anyone serious about hunting.\" Dexter confirmed, casting a wary glance at the gruesome sight. \"I keep quite the collection actually.\"\n\n\"Did you and Harry have any bad blood?\"\n\n\"He disrespected me... but that's public knowledge.\" Dexter replied, his smile not reaching his eyes this time. His hands clenched as he added, \"Mocked my faith, right in front of everyone at a ceremony.\"\n\n\"Your faith is important to you?\"\n\n\"Faith defines me, Winston.\" Dexter said emphatically, \"It's everything to me.\"\n\n\"We'll be in touch.\" Winston assured, nodding before he turned to leave, leaving Dexter standing by the chalet, the scarlet sunset painting a vibrant backdrop to the grim crime scene.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Charlotte's kitchen was spick and span, a stark contrast to what had transpired there not too long ago. The housekeeper had provided one striking piece of information: Charlotte and Letti had been alone in that kitchen.\n\nHe had questioned Letti earlier that day. The woman was infamous around the local rock concerts as a persistent groupie, and that's how she had met Charlotte. Charlotte had invited Letti over for dinner, a friendly gesture, or perhaps something else. The surveillance footage of Letti entering Charlotte's house supported the claim of her attendance.\n\nAs he started to piece together the information, he noticed something peculiar. Charlotte's body was found filled with sawdust, and posed in a lifelike position. An odd choice for a common murder. \n\nGoing back to his interview with Letti, she had a discernable excitement to talk about her latest collection--taxidermy specimens. Even from the outside of her house, one could often spot new specimens being brought in for her collection. Within her house, she had a dedicated room just for displaying them. \n\nHe delayed his visit to her house as he had to detour his investigation to a local pawn shop thanks to a timely tip from the precinct. The shop was known as a hotspot for those in need of quick personal protection items, stun guns being one of the favorites. The storekeeper was able to confirm that a woman fitting Letti's description had indeed been in the shop on the day of Charlotte's death and had bought a stun gun. \n\nWinston noted, during his conversation with her, that Letti had been seen effectively using a stun gun at a concert previously. Overtly confident, maybe due to the self-defense classes she had taken where they taught proper use of a stun gun.\n\n\"Interesting hobby you've got, Letti, taxidermy isn't it?\" Winston asked casually.\n\n\"Never a dull moment with it that's for sure,\" Letti shared, \"I just got a new badger a few days ago and been itching to stuff it.\"\n\n\"... and you have personal security, with the stun gun, huh?\" he questioned subtly.\n\n\"Can't be too careful these days, detective,\" she replied with a smirk.\n\n\"Seems prudent,\" he said, holding back any assumption of guilt, \"Enjoy your new badger, Letti.\"\n\nWinston left the encounter replaying every response, every body language, every innocuous detail he gathered. Just another piece of a puzzle waiting to be solved. Time would reveal more, he reckoned and left for the precinct.\n\nWinston could feel the tension in the air as he pulled his vehicle into the driveway of Deborah's house. He knew that there was a lot of bad blood between the victim, Charlotte, and his current person of interest, Deborah. Charlotte had reportedly been continually harsh to Deborah in public, creating a hostile work environment and undermining Deborah's reputation both professionally and personally.\n\nJust a short time before the murder occurred, Deborah arrived at Charlotte's house in response to a job invite from Charlotte. This was confirmed by a neighbor who saw her pull up in her car. As he approached the door, he glanced down to see the only items of interest in the driveway - a collection of house keys and what looked like a self-defense weapon. An acquaintance of Deborah reportedly saw her purchasing a stun gun recently, and indeed saw her carrying it as she entered Charlotte's house, that was the last time she was seen with it. Yet it wasn’t necessarily an uncommon purchase considering Deborah's past as a security officer.\n\n\"Detective Winston...\" Deborah greeted him as she opened the door.\n\n\"Deborah,\" he replied, holding up a warrant. She stepped back to let him in, confusion marking her face.\n\nWinston followed Deborah into the kitchen and instinctively glanced around. The kitchen utensils were put away, the counter was cleaned, everything seemed to be in place. Charlotte, the victim, had always been meticulous about her surroundings, perhaps an underlying reason for the rift between her and Deborah.\n\n\"May I ask why you had keys to Charlotte's house?\" Winston asked, turning his gaze onto Deborah.\n\n\"Charlotte asked me over for a job, and she left the keys for me since she wouldn't be home,\" she replied, emotion slowly creeping up on her face.\n\n\"And the stun gun on your belt...\" he prompted, gesturing towards the weapon.\n\n\"As a former security guard, I've got a permit,\" Deborah quickly replied, \"I've had it for ages. I used it when I had to maintain order or defend myself.\"\n\nThere was a short silence as Winston absorbed this information. \"I understand Charlotte has been ill-treating you in public. Is this true, Deborah?\"\n\nDeborah seemed to choke on her words before finding her voice, \"Yeah, and it wasn't just in public. She just... she just didn't stop.\"\n\n\"And the rumors? Did you try talking to her about them?\"\n\nShe nodded, \"Several times, but she didn't stop.\"\n\nAs Winston was leaving, he glanced back at the quiet house. Charlotte's house was found locked when the body was found... locked from the outside.\n\n\"I'll be in touch,\" Winston told Deborah as he walked towards his car. Images of Deborah arriving to Charlotte’s house with her stun gun, moments before Charlotte’s murder, replayed in his mind. Deborah's figure in the doorway became smaller as he drove away, preparing for what was yet another knot in this unraveling mystery.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

It projected grainy CCTV footage of his suspect - Marianne. She was there at the roller rink, on the night poor Wendy met her end. Not only was Marianne there - she was seen shouting at Wendy, their voices escalating until they pierced the rhythmic hum of the skating wheels. The timestamp of the argument, and subsequent footage of Marianne lingering, suggested she was there for quite some time after her dispute with Wendy.\n\nHe thumbed through a thin folder tucked beneath a closing pizza box resting on his cluttered desk. Marianne had a criminal record, it revealed a past fraught with moments of explosion, of violence - including an assault arrest five years prior. The Marianne on the screen, the Marianne in these documents had been caught in the wrong before. Winston began to feel a creeping uneasiness as he parsed this correlation. \n\nSeveral pictures tumbled from the folder as Winston shuffled its contents. The pictures were snapshots of Marianne: caught in the midst of her day-to-day, widely recognized by the community - not just for her nature but for her frequent use of an old pickaxe. It came as no surprise since she had spent several years working in the mines before her marriage. She was seen using her pickaxe for numerous tasks such as chopping firewood or loosening soil in her garden. \n\n\"Did you see what she was doing last week?\" a seasoned woman down the road had mentioned as she was reversing her car out of the driveway. Marianne was seen cleaning her well-worn mining equipment that she'd kept stored in an easily accessible tool-shed next to her house in clear sight. It seemed she wasn't shy about flaunting her past or the tools she used while in the mines.\n\nCommotion at the precinct broke Winston from his thoughts. The crime-scene analyst reported the murder took place in some remote corner of the roller rink. Despite the public dispute that took place earlier between Wendy and Marianne, this location seemed isolated, uncanny for such a busy locale.\n\nThe analyst's words seemed to chisel further into Winston's thoughts as he returned to the grainy images. Her mining equipment was never far from reach, and Marian's cacophony on the night of Wendy's murder was caught on tape. \n\nPieces started falling into place; too many strings tethered Marianne to the night Wendy was murdered. With a sigh, Winston allowed himself a quiet moment. Then, taking a deep breath, he began his descent into the intricacies of the case before him.\n\nWinston stood at the entrance of the roller rink, eyes scanning the room. The images from the crime scene report replayed in his memory. Poor Wendy had breathed her last in what was supposed to be a place filled with the rejuvenating sounds of retro music and flashing lights.\n\nSidney, who was a geologist, had been seen with Wendy at the roller rink multiple times. According to the staff, Sidney was even a regular here. It was a curious detail but not unusual, people had hobbies apart from their professions. Sidney's passion besides analyzing layers of earth was rollerblading. He frequently carried his tools, including his pickaxe, from his daytime geological survey sites directly to the roller rink in the evenings.\n\nChecking his notes from the previous conversation with Sidney, his eyebrows knitted slightly as he remembered the desperation he sensed from Sidney. It revolved around Wendy, who apparently knew something he coveted as a secret. She had been sharing this secret with her friends and it seemed it held the power to publicly humiliate Sidney if it ever came to light. Sidney, for his part, vehemently denied any secret of such scale.\n\nWinston gestured for the barista to come over. The young man with a skater haircut glanced at Winston's badge before he ordered a black coffee with no sugar. While waiting for his order, he asked, “Did you notice Sidney here during the time of the incident?”\n\nThe barista nodded, nervously biting his lower lip. \"Yes, Detective. Sidney was here. I remember seeing him.\"\n\nWinston nodded as he continued his observations. His gaze lingered over Sidney's station where he parked his geologist’s gear, including his trusted pickaxe, which he used during his geological field trips, when he visited. He noticed the stains of usual wear and tear and a freshly cleaned pickaxe leaning against the wall. Nothing unusual for a geologist. Taking down notes, Winston silently queued the information; the same Pickaxe might have been used for the murder.\n\nHis phone buzzed breaking his trail of thoughts, He took the informer's call. He glanced at his watch noting down the time of the conversation before disconnecting the call. He finished his coffee and left the roller rink. He had to confirm if Wendy was indeed telling the truth about that secret or Sidney was just an innocent geologist who loved rollerblading and hated gossips.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Instagram photos and notes, discovered by Xochitl, declared that Olivia had intentions to seriously harm Xochitl's sister and ruin her life. Olivia's actions had extended to constant harassment, as per statements from numerous local residents. \n\nThat's when Winston set his eyes on Xochitl for the first time. A town local, known for conducting regular Tarot readings, she was known to have a strong inclination towards rituals and esoteric practices. The temple was often her stage for spiritual enlightenment, which required the uncorking of ritualistic wine bottles with a trusty corkscrew, a habit she had grown accustomed to.\n\nWinston approached her while she was meticulously packing away her Tarot cards, her dark, expressive eyes betraying a myriad of deep emotions. \"Are you always this involved in your...ritual practices?\" he asked, noting her obvious devotion. \"Yes,\" she responded, her voice barely rising above the rustling of her Tarot cards. \"It has become a part of me, something very close to my heart.\"\n\nWinston paused before asking about her trips. Xochitl's expression faltered a bit as she looked at him, then away. \"They happen now and then,\" she said calmly, swiftly changing the subject to the next upcoming spiritual gathering. Winston noted that her trips were far from listed on her nearby calendar, a fact he filed away on his internal docket.\n\nConversation shifted, and Xochitl showered her sister with affection. She shared a story of a recent conflict Olivia had with her sister, one laced with threats to ruin her life. The passion with which Xochitl narrated the story was palpable.\n\nAs Winston was exiting, he caught sight of various trinkets littered around Xochitl's space. A glance at one of the suitcase tags confirmed it had an origin from a foreign country. He recalls how the locals often gossiped about Xochitl bringing back a new trinket or souvenir from each trip she made, adding to her ever-growing collection. It was the same country that matched one of Xochitl's passport stamps -- a souvenir from her unmarked trips perhaps. The details of her travels remained shrouded in mystery, with Xochitl deftly avoiding deeper conversations about these.\n\n\"I'll speak with you soon, Xochitl,\" Winston affirmed as he left, feeling a complex web of possibilities dissecting in his mind. Curious about the tie between Xochitl, her mysterious trips, the souvenirs and the tragic murder, he was determined to peel back the layers of ambiguity surrounding this case.\n\nIn the wake of the unfortunate event at the local temple, Detective Winston flipped through the details of the victims. A familiar sense of dread had come to accompany the name of Olivia – similar to the other women whose investigations he had compiled over time, yet still distinctly unique. It spurred the creeping sensation of a suspected serial killer at large.\n\n“There’s something about this delivery guy…” he murmured, pulling a file, filled with suspicions, on Martin, a package delivery driver. Winston had previously handled several investigations related to Martin for similar incidents, but they had all gone cold. “Is it déjà vu?”\n\nHe shuffled through the documents in Martin's file. The delivery man, as per his employer’s statement, made regular visits to the temple for his deliveries, which interestingly enough, had also happened on the fateful day Olivia was found dead. Today, he was scheduled to deliver a package to none other than Olivia herself.\n\nAs Winston read further, he scratched the stubble on his chin, remembering a tidbit he had come across in one of the previous investigations. Martin had this... peculiar method of opening packages, using a corkscrew. Yes, a corkscrew of all things. And that was a part of his regular equipment, he would carry it with him every day.\n\nQuirkily, during an early afternoon surveillance encounter upon one of his visits at the temple on the very day of the murder, Martin was seen carrying his odd tool, the corkscrew.\n\n\"It's ironic, don't you think?\" One of his fellow officers had remarked dryly. \"Our potential serial killer and his corkscrew.\"\n\nWinston refrained from comment, remembering the discrepancies that had led those cases to grow cold. Several of them were left inconclusive - always touch and go - with evidence that went around in circles but never quite completed the picture.\n\nAs he went through his notes, Winston noticed another uncanny resemblance - Olivia was quite similar in appearance to the past victims; young, brunette, and striking eyes.\n\nFingers drumming against the cool, polished surface of his wooden desk, Winston reviewed Martin’s work log. It noted the driver was prescheduled enough to have him at the temple around the suspected time of Olivia’s demise that day. With furrowed brows, he made note of the temple's solitary condition during the time - not another soul around.\n\nToo many coincidences and not enough clarity. Winston sighed heavily, clicking his pen shut. The more things unravelled, the more they seemed convoluted. But he knew better than to pinpoint connections. For now, it was about gathering facts, no matter how cryptic.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Xochitl\nB.

Timothy, smiling, pushing through a crowd at the local laser tag arena, cheeks flushed from excitement in one, poised to score a point in another. A slapdash collage of an otherwise rather mundane event that had turned fatal.\n\nEugene had made quite a bit of fuss about the event in a recent tweet that came to Winston's memory, \"Thrilled to have my dear friend and talented novelist Timothy join in our laser tag match next week!\" \n\nOne week before this fatal match, Winston recalled his shock when he learnt that Eugene had updated his insurance policy. The timing suddenly seemed sinister in retrospect. Well, that week, the one that had passed, and suddenly the photos of Timothy looking happy, even enthusiastic, took on a dark tone. Images of Timothy registering his name for the event passed his mind.\n\nUnsettling was the sheer amount of Eugene's insurance payout that Winston had stumbled upon. The number next to Timothy's name on the updated policy was massive, a windfall capable of mollifying anyone's financial struggles. And last time he checked, Timothy had his share of those.\n\nWinston idly wondered if Timothy had sweat off his anxiety during his weekly martial arts class. Had Timothy been ramping up his normal routine, given the abundance of textbooks and training manuals that Winston had seen at Timothy's apartment during an earlier visit? \n\nSetting aside that train of thoughts, Winston remembered how his eyebrows had arched when he had realized Eugene had added Timothy on his updated insurance policy. The troubling image of the man in the photos, nunchaku in hand, in a laser tag arena was threading an unsettling narrative through Winston's mind. Perhaps he'd taken the martial arts fascination a step too far? Or had too much of a stake in a possible payout from an insurance policy? \n\nWinston recalled his earlier conversation with Timothy. \"So, you're quite the laser tag enthusiast,\" he'd mentioned casually. \"Yeah, Eugene and I played quite frequently,\" Timothy had replied, a mixture of sadness and an undercurrent of something else Winston couldn't quite place, tainting the response, \"we were supposed to team up at this event too. In fact, I've already signed up.\"\n\nWith a tired sigh, Winston looked again at the photos. Timothy, at the event, right where he was expected to be. The mystery was not about where, rather it was about why. He took one last sip from his rapidly cooling coffee, his thoughts turning towards the next step of his investigation.\n\nIn the muffled fluorescent light of the zoo's administrative office, Winston could just see hanging behind opened envelopes and fading photographs, a colorful poster advertising themed nunchaku sticks for sale at the gift shop in the lobby. In the meantime, his eyes watched Adam, today's suspect, who sat uncomfortably in his chair.\n\nAdam was not just an employee but the owner of the zoo, a responsibility passed down to him from generations of family business. Currently though, he was fidgeting with a pair of nunchaku, a martial arts weapon he frequently practiced with during breaks at the zoo. Even more peculiar, some of the staff had confirmed spotting Adam purchasing those very nunchaku from the zoo gift shop. His fascination with martial arts, it seemed, didn't just end at practicing forms but extended to owning the paraphernalia too.\n\nThe office was a small place, cozy but not private. Winston suspected that the rest of the zoo staff would have easy access to this space. Adam's desk, overloaded with paperwork, had an open drawer revealing some ticket stubs and travel documents. Winston noted this silently, deciding to ask Adam about his recent trips. However, as expected from his rather secretive body language, Adam’s responses were evasive and noncommittal. He became particularly agitated at the mention of his travels.\n\nBefore Winston could push any further about the travels, he noticed a thick file tucked away at the corner of the table. It was stamped \"Evidence\" and it contained multiple safety violation notices issued to Adam's zoo. The named complainant in most was the deceased, Eugene.\n\nAdam's body seemed to tighten at the mention of Eugene, and his fraught reaction to the heated argument they had over safety concerns was palpable. But behind his weariness, he still managed to ethnically dismiss these allegations.\n\nThere was no overt mention of the nunchaku made by Adam, perhaps he saw no relevance in disclosing it. But Winston could read between the lines. From the way Adam toyed with his martial art's weapon to the sighting of him purchasing it from the gift shop, to the tickets for the town sports center, which had a schedule coinciding with the zookeeper animal feeding times. The dots were momentarily connecting in Winston's head, but he retained his poker face. He stood up, thanked Adam, and prepared to leave.\n\nAs he walked towards the exit of the administrative office, he turned back to look once more at Adam, who was striking a helpless posture under the banner of family heritage that hung behind him. It was clear that this case had just gotten more intriguing.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Timothy\nB.

It was the same day Jim, the famous wrestler, had been murdered. He snuffed out his cigarette, pocketed the ticket, and made his way toward his interview with Roxanne.\n\nHe found Roxanne nursing a cup of tea in a spacious apartment, its décor tinged with layers of transient life. Among various moving boxes, catching his attention were the remnants of a ticket in a drawer, aligning precisely with the one he pocketed, indicating it had been retrieved from there before the event. He noticed a handful of discarded sim cards on the table, each from a different carrier, indicating she had likely changed her phone number several times.\n\n“Roxanne, is it?” Winston began. His words were met with a curt nod.\n\n\"That wrestling match ticket I found at your place, you attended the same event that Jim did, didn’t you?\" Winston pushed the evidence bag toward Roxanne. She had meticulously planned to attend this wrestling show, as evidenced by the ticket fragments in her drawer.\n\nShe squared her shoulders and admitted, \"Yes, I'm a big fan of wrestling, and Jim always attracted the crowd.\"\n\nFlicking through his notes, Winston proceeded. \"Looks like you work in healthcare, Roxanne, a nurse, correct?\"\n\nWith a tad of confusion etched on her face, Roxanne admitted as such.\n\nDespite her career, Winston saw her adeptness in subjects beyond her field. She had done her fair share of questionable research, she knew bleach could be a useful tool, not just for cleaning. Winston received a tip-off about her internet search history pointing toward research on bleach poisoning.\n\nHe decided to dig a little deeper. \"At the pharmacy, where you bought the bleach, the CCTV footage showed you making that purchase.\" He let her know how he came across the information. Her flinch of surprise was hard to miss.\n\nSnowballing into more dire topics, Winston mentioned a recent spat taking place on her front lawn. Roxanne's family had heatedly argued with her. \"Your family has been trying to reach you,\" Winston gestured towards the stack of letters in the corner.\n\nSighing, Roxanne admitted that things had escalated until she left the location in a huff, ignoring repeated attempts by her family to get back in touch. \n\n\"No neighbors. I move... a lot,\" Roxanne confessed, changing the topic. \n\nWinston frowned. He needed to know why there were no reports of stolen bleach near pharmacies surrounding both the wrestling arena and Roxanne's current residence. But he decided to leave that for another time.\n\nOn his way out, Winston muttered a quiet \"thank you\" before he left Roxanne to her solitude. As he departed, he stole one last glance at the stacks of unopened letters sitting forlornly in the corner. There was an awful lot to unravel here, it seemed. Yet, as always, Winston knew the truth was buried somewhere, waiting to be unearthed.\n\nWinston had spent the day visiting the wrestling ring where Jim’s body had been found. As the man responsible for orchestrating the match, including assigning responsibilities to the referees, the matter had naturally become deeply personal to Clyde. Not to mention, he was a plumber and was therefore in a kind of position that made it hard for people to not remember him. The wrestling match was held late at night, when he could manage time from his job, and it just so happened that most people had already left for their homes by the end of it. Winston remembered seeing Jim flirting openly with Clyde's ex-girlfriend during the event. It was a sight hard to forget. He picked up his camera bag, preparing for the night’s task. It wouldn't be pretty, but it was necessary.\n\nWinston decided to ask Clyde about the match first, \"What are the criteria for a good referee in the match, Clyde?\" The question was a simple icebreaker.\n\nClyde shrugged, looking at Winston with a puzzled look. \"Well... referees need to control the wrestlers, redirect their energy if it goes astray. Also, they have the responsibility to overlook the match, ensure that it runs smooth and everyone plays by the rules.\"\n\nMeeting with the burly plumber, who also moonlighted as the wrestling match organizer, was a step that needed to occur. He was seen leaving the ring after the night's wrestling events with Jim. It was a fact that couldn't be simply glanced over.\n\nWinston, with a voice steady as a rock asked, \"A tad unusual, Clyde, you two leaving together. Was it not?\"\n\nClyde shifted uncomfortably, \"Naw, detective. It was late, and most folks had already gone home. Just tidyin' up, you know.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Winston replied. Clyde’s bleach-streaked work clothes were a testament to his plumbing job. Always smelling strongly of bleach. \"And don’t plumbers often use bleach for cleaning purposes?\" Winston emphasised his point.\n\nA shrug from Clyde gave Winston the satisfaction of confirmation. \"It's got plenty uses, detective. And yeah, a good clean ain't possible without some bleach.\"\n\nHis coworkers could vouch for his frequent bleach-infused work clothes. A distinct, eye-watering odor. Winston recognized it as he walked towards him. Yes, he couldn't ignore the strong smell of bleach.\n\nInstead of pushing the issue, Winston decided to turn the conversation towards Clyde’s past. He had treated his ex-girlfriends more like possessions than partners and had recently been seen spying on Jim and his ex-girlfriend - a woman Jim had been openly flirting with at the wrestling matches and who had confirmed that she was now dating Jim.\n\n\"Clyde,\" Winston began, all seriousness, \"we got reports of you looking into Jim and his... interests, other than wrestling, can you shed some light on that?\"\n\nClyde shifted again, \"Well, detective, that ain't nothing but...but concern, you see, for my ex.\"\n\nWinston simply nodded, staying silent. He had to stay neutral, had to listen to both sides of the story before he could make his conclusion. And that's exactly what he did. Letting Clyde make his explanation, was it concern or possessiveness camouflaged? Perhaps a bit of both. It was a tangled web, one Winston was sure to unravel eventually.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Clyde\nB.

The old dusty building sat in the middle of downtown, open 24 hours to cater to the city-life fitness enthusiasts. The 24-hour timing of the gym provided Isaac a place to be when he was working late. It also afforded Milton, the alleged tax evader and the building owner, numerous opportunities to encounter Isaac.\n\nFor years Winston had known about the gym, a small struggling space owned and operated by Isaac, an IRS agent turned yoga instructor, who had been found dead there the previous night - shot dead with what appeared to be a shotgun. Isaac, with his whistleblowing nature, had recently acquired extensive evidence on a tax evasion scheme. This scheme was alleged to be run by none other than Milton.\n\nWinston spotted Milton, the robust man in his sixties and owner of the building, emerging from the fitness center. An overcast of suspicion hung over Milton as he owned several other buildings in the area, all implicated in his alleged tax evasion scandal.\n\nRevealing his badge, Winston introduced himself, \"Detective Winston. I'd like to ask a few questions.\" Milton, nonchalant as always, simply answered, \"About Isaac?\"\n\n\"Yeah... You knew him well?\"\n\nMilton adjusted the strap of his shotgun before answering, \"He was a tenant. That's all.\"\n\nWinston furrowed his brows, \"That shotgun - it's legal!\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Milton declared, \"I even passed the required training course. The local authorities granted me a license.\"\n\nWinston's eyes darted to the keys in the man's hand, \"I see you also have keys to the gym.\"\n\n\"It's my property, Detective,\" Milton responded dismissively.\n\nWinston sighed, unfazed by Milton's audacity, \"It's undisputed that the gym is never locked yet Isaac was alone last night. He had potential evidence that could have sent you to prison, Milton.\"\n\n\"So?\" Milton's face revealed no fear and no hint of adversity.\n\nThis reaction gnawed at Winston as he returned to his car. Thoughts of Isaac's murder - the shotgun wound matching the one Milton regularly carried, Milton's unfazed demeanor despite the possible charges, and Milton's evident firearms training - swarmed his mind. As he mulled over these facts, he made a mental note to delve deeper into Isaac's evidence - the potential key to exposing Milton's illicit activities and ensuring justice.\n\nWinston squinted his eyes, scanning the familiar hustle and bustle of the fitness center. The crime scene of Isaac's murder was abnormal, the contrast of violence against the backdrop of health and vitality. \n\nDodging a stray basketball, he made his way to the bench where Alice and Isaac used to workout together regularly. Alice had a spotless record with the fitness center - seemed she had never missed a month of membership dues.\n\nAs he advanced, he remembered a fact shared by Alice's friends. They had alluded to how Alice sneakily mentioned fight club every Tuesday night, a pattern they had quickly noticed.\n\nSpotting the middle-aged woman, he strode toward Alice. Her movements were graceful as she pulled down the levels, her muscles contracting with every repetition. She had been in the military, particularly in a special weapons unit where her training with shotguns had given her an edge. Her fitness regime bore witness to that, and she knew her way around weapons- the shotgun she recently purchased was just a testament to that.\n\n\"Hello Alice,\" he initiated the conversation. He knew patience was key in such delicate interrogations, especially with suspects like Alice.\n\n\"Oh, Winston, what an unexpected surprise!\" Alice's face lit up with genuine surprise, her eyes shifting to the shotgun propped at the corner of the bench, its presence undeniable.\n\nDiscarding any pleasantries, Winston moved to the crux of the matter. \"Isaac trained right here didn’t he, you guys used to train together?\"\n\nAlice gave a small nod, memories flickering in her eyes. Winston observed her, recognizing a trace of melancholy. Alice’s dulcet voice broke the silence. \"Yes...we had a sort of routine together.\"\n\nHe glanced at her bruised knuckles appreciatively, a new patch of purple catching his attention. Her friends had mentioned Alice's weekly fight club rendezvous every Tuesday night. The tough soldier, habituated to the brutality of the fight club, would invariably return home every Wednesday morning nursing fresh battle sores.\n\nAlice was a puzzle piece in a complex jigsaw puzzle. An aunt, a loyal fitness center member, a fighter, and undoubtedly an experienced shotgun user due to her military background. Her every Tuesday night fights stood out starkly against her normal routine. She was a conundrum tightly bound by her routine, fitness center membership, military background, and her recent shotgun purchase.\n\n\"You know Winston...Isaac was the only family I had left,\" Alice mused, her thoughts clearly going down a memory lane, her fingers tracing her recent shotgun casually. The shotgun she had recently purchased was now in her possession. With these words, she abruptly stood up, signaled the trainer for her next routine, leaving Winston to join the dots of the puzzle she represented in this murder mystery.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

He'd been mulling over the crime scene photos of Guy strewn across the cold shopping mall floor all day - it was a grim sight. The neon clock on the wall read 10 pm, the same time the murder had happened.\n\nHe shoved the photos in their manila envelope and, clearing his heavy thoughts, he decided to pay a visit to the niece of Guy, Peyton. \n\nReaching the site Peyton worked during her daytime shift, smoke and the clamour of heavy machinery engulfed him. He could see men bustling about the site in hard hats and safety vests. He spotted Peyton in her fluorescent safety vest and hard hat, her face smeared with dust. \n\nObserving the bandage-covered wounds, Winston asked, “Are your colleagues, the ones over there, as uninformed as they seem about your injuries?” \n\nPeyton gave a shrill laugh before admitting, \"To be honest, they really don't have a clue about it. They're kept in the dark, which is how I prefer it. Some things are better left unspoken, detective.\" With a shrug, she diverted the conversation towards the construction progress.\n\nWinston sighed, he'd heard about her evasiveness from her colleagues. \n\nA few days later Winston was back, this time at Peyton's martial arts training institute. The instructor was a burly guy, with massive tattooed arms. The man confirmed that Peyton had been training with him and she was proficient in handling a sai. \n\nAs Winston turned to leave, he asked, “Does she train often?”\n\n“Regular as clockwork, she's here weekly. She is, indeed, dedicated.” The instructor replied. \n\nPeyton’s dedication found its way to Winston’s mind on his way to her house - the same dedication she put into her hobby. The house was filled with all kinds of trinkets and weapons, but what caught Winston's eye were the sais. Winston could see an empty spot in the case where three sais were supposed to be.\n\n“I knew Guy,” she said after a moment of silence, jostling Winston out of his thoughts. “In fact, I was in the same shopping mall that night, you know, just for shopping.”\n\nWinston tilted his head, studying her closely. “Indeed?” \n\n“Yes...”  She muttered distractedly, “I shop there often. You can say 'shopping' is one of my few indulgences.”\n\nWinston nodded, thanked her for her time, and started for his car. There were too many questions bouncing around in his head, so he chose to retreat for the day. \n\nAs Winston was leaving the driveway, he took one last glance at Peyton's house, “At least one thing’s for sure... she really does love that shopping mall.” He mumbled to himself and drove off into the night.\n\nWinston looked at the crime scene photos, strewn across his desk. A shopping mall of all places. And a sai as a murder weapon - the forensic team had already confirmed that it belonged to a set like the one behind Isolde's bar counter. The victim, a decent-looking chap named Guy. His family had reported he frequently voiced displeasure about a certain bartender... a woman named Isolde. He complained about how she would neglect his orders and how she threw racial slurs his way.\n\nGuy's coworkers had even confided in Winston that they'd overhead him telling stories of racial slurs made by Isolde. The hostility had elevated to such a degree that Isolde officially refused to serve him a drink, for the reason that he belonged to that certain ethnic background she had indisputable prejudice towards.\n\nWhat was also interesting was that Isolde held a high rank in the local martial arts school. She was a formidable black belter specializing in sai, the very same weapon that ended Guy's life. This revelation deepened Winston's suspicion as he found out that Isolde was seen practicing with sai at her school quite frequently.\n\nWinston printed out a map and set a route to pay Isolde a visit at her bar.\n\nAs he entered the bar, Winston's detective instincts took over, his gaze passing over the customers before finally falling on Isolde, busy at work behind the counter. \"Miss Isolde?\" Winston called, striding up to the bar. \n\nIsolde turned, offering a thin smile that didn't meet her eyes. \"At your service.\" \n\nHe launched into his questioning, starting simple. \"You were working at the time of the murder?\"\n\nIsolde nodded, her dark gaze unwavering. \"I work here every day, morning till evening. This is my bar.\"\n\n\"And you had Guy here at your bar that day?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"He always came here,\" Isolde replied, her gaze shifting to a spot behind Winston's shoulder before confirming, \"Yes, he was here.\"\n\nWinston, then, noticed something peculiar. He followed her gaze to an area at the corner of bar. It was a display stand that usually held a pair of sai, one of them was conspicuously missing.\n\nWinston pulled out his phone, showing Isolde an image amidst a series of them. It was a CCTV grab. Guy, entering the bar. \n\n\"Heard you mentioned Guy was here,\" he said, looping back to his original topic. \"You were seen talking to him, even arguing.\"\n\nIsolde sighed, rubbing her thumb over the stained counter. \"I won't lie. We had our disagreements. He wasn't fond of some of my... posts.\"\n\nWinston brought up the topic she was alluding to - the derogatory comments she'd posted online about Guy's ethnicity. While Winston couldn't accuse or press suspicion onto her, it was one more piece in the puzzle firmly logged in his mind.\n\nWinston ended the questioning with a final request for her to remain cooperative during the ongoing investigation. With a polite nod, Isolde agreed as he left, leaving him under no illusions; this case was far from being cracked.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Peyton\nB.

Currently, he was on a murder case - the victim being a gentleman named Henry. Winston had recently discovered that Henry was murdered in a vineyard using a vial of acid. Intriguing, he thought to himself.\n\nWinston's first stop was a the local flower shop, which surprisingly had a distinct smell of chemicals mingled with the floral aroma. Here, he met the florist, Ruben. It was widely known that Ruben was the only florist Henry trusted for his vineyard.\n\nOn interacting with Ruben, Winston learned that Ruben supplied flowers to the vineyard and that Henry had indeed placed an order on the day of his murder. Ruben had an array of corrosive chemicals at his shop, which he claimed to use in his florist work, including various acids. Moreover, when asked about these, Ruben mentioned he studied Chemistry in University.\n\n\"In fact,\" Ruben added, \"I even use acetic acid regularly for the flower arrangement.\" This aroused Winston's suspicion but kept his thoughts to himself. Soon after, the vineyard's manager confirmed Ruben's presence at vineyard in the afternoon on the day of the murder. Winston headed back to the station, his mind filled with questions.\n\nLater in the day, Winston met with Ruben's niece. She had been visibly upset lately. He remembered hearing a report about Henry engaging in inappropriate behavior with her. He noted she hesitated a bit, but then revealed how Henry sent her threatening messages.\n\nAfter learning everything from Ruben's niece, Winston decided to pay Ruben another visit. When Winston mentioned Henry's improper actions towards his niece, Ruben's demeanor changed. He reluctantly revealed he'd confronted Henry about it before.\n\n\"His words were like poison, make no mistake,\" said Ruben, his gaze was faraway and filled with regret.\n\nWinston nodded, \"Indeed they were\", he remarked, leaving the shop with more questions than answers. All he had were the facts, and slowly he was starting to see the bigger picture - but he knew better than to jump to conclusions himself.\n\nDetective Winston ran a hand over his stubbled chin as he studied the photos before him. The vineyard where they'd found Henry was usually a place of peace and tranquility, gilded in gold rays of afternoon sun and playing host to the chirps of the birds and the hum of the insects. But something horrible had happened here, and the scene’s cheer was forever stained.\n\nFirst on his list was an archaeologist by the name of Michael. The man had a history with the victim and was known around circles for his reckless behavior. Notably, illegal drug use. Recalling the empty vials found at the crime scene and remembering the rumors of Michael often seen under the influence of some substance at work or home, Winston eyed the crime scene images one more time before tucking them away and heading for his cruiser.\n\nEntering the archaeologist's house was akin to stepping into the pages of an endangered species book. A taxidermied animal posed in the corner of every room, the savage beauty of nature juxtaposed against mundane household decor. Winston frowned at the animals. One thing was clear. Michael took pride in his collection.\n\n\"I see you appreciate the decor, Detective,\" came Michael’s voice from the entryway. He was clutching a book to his chest as he stepped into the room. Winston promptly identified the book as the same endangered species directory he'd seen in the crime scene photos. Thumbed pages marked which animals in his collection were endangered.\n\nEngaging in conversation, Winston unearthed more about Michael's profession. Specifically, he learned about Michael's specialized training in handling and disposing of dangerous substances, particularly acid, which was used for cleaning artifacts. It wasn't surprising then, when Michael admitted that he had misused the acid at his workplace a few times and even taken some home for personal use.\n\nHowever, when it came to intoxicating substances, acid was not the only one Michael dabbled in. The archaeologist had been caught using heroin numerous times, appearing to be in a constant state of high intoxication. Winston pitied the man when he admitted it himself, though present sobriety and the bragging tone suggested no remorse.\n\nBefore Winston could turn the topic to Henry, Michael dropped a bomb of his own. He was aware that Henry knew about his drug problem and even offered to expose it. The news didn't faze Winston.\n\nAs he was leaving, Winston cast another round of looks at the quiet occupants of the corners. Michael followed his gaze and nodded in confirmation once more: they were all part of his personal collection. Not pets, not symbols of studied fauna, but trophy displays of a man who kept too many secrets. The detective's job was to unravel them and bring the truth to light.\n\nAs the front door closed behind him, Winston took a moment to watch the house from his car, the conversation replaying in his head. He had more research to do. The job was far from over. The job was far from over.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Ruben\nB.

Savannah, who was leading in the polls, was clearly the people's choice for the election. The upcoming political rally had been plastered about town for weeks, making it an inevitability known to all.\n\nWinston scratched at an internal itch and trudged onto another stakeout. Larry, the man he was looking to question, was apparently active in a local survivalist group. Flipping open his notebook, Winston noted that Larry was a war veteran who had gone to significant lengths campaigning himself. Posters of Larry bearing the tagline \"Whatever it takes\" dotted the town too.\n\nWinston watched as Larry scrutinized each one with such intensity that it seemed like his entire identity was tied to the outcome of this election. The survivalist meetings took place in Larry's private property, which he had converted into a fortified camp after pumping his entire fortune into his campaign.\n\nWinston decided to pay a visit to Larry to know more about him and his involvement in the race. They met at Larry's camp, a spit-and-polish place that reflected Larry's military background. Crisp flags snapped in the wind and the entire setting was punctuated by the distinct scent of gun oil.\n\n\"Thank you for your service,\" Winston began, extending a handshake to Larry who returned it with an iron grip. It's well-known that war veterans like Larry are experienced with various forms of weaponry, including flamethrowers. True to this, an errant flamethrower was left out in the open at his camp, catching Winston's eye. A flame thrower, not entirely strange for a survivalist's camp, was an interesting detail, considering the bizarre circumstances of Savannah's death.\n\nAs they chatted, Winston learned that Larry and Savannah were political rivals. Larry preferred to attend every rally personally. In fact, even though they stood on opposing political platforms, Larry never missed any of Savannah's rallies.\n\n\"I respect my opponent,\" said Larry, his gaze distant. \"It's her policies I have a problem with.\"\n\nWinston wrapped up the brief visit with a polite nod. As he left Larry's camp, the veteran-turned-politician watched with a grim smile that left Winston looking back at Savannah's campaign poster with a different perspective.\n\nUnder the harsh whiteness of the police station lights, Winston eyed the smartly dressed woman with a critical gaze. Sophia, they called her. A journalist. She was a fine-boned woman, older, maybe late forties, with a reputation for relentless pursuit of stories. And not just that, she had a remarkable reputation of not lying or hiding truths, even under the most severe pressures.\n\n\"Sophia, you worked on coverage of the military exhibition last month, right?\" he started, watching her eyes carefully for subtle reactions.\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" she said coolly. She looked him directly in the eyes, without a hint of evasion. \"I am entrusted with sometimes sensitive information. I don't lie or hide truths, detective. I take my job quite seriously.\"\n\nSeeing her intensity, Winston was not surprised. She was invested in her career, in truth-seeking, more than most. But her career, it seemed to Winston, was teetering on the edge. His notes said something about job stability issues.\n\n\"I heard from various sources that your job as a journalist could be at risk, Sophia.\"\n\nA flicker of annoyance crossed Sophia's eyes. \"Every job carries elements of risk and taking risks is crucial for growth, detective,\" she replied firmly.\n\nWinston took note of that and moved on to another point. \"Is it true that you managed to keep a flamethrower from the exhibition?\"\n\nA pause. Then a nod. \"I did keep a flamethrower... to study it further for my report. Is that a crime?\" she asked pointedly, her reputation for truthfulness evident. A defiant posture, not backing down easily, but then that's what made her good at her job, the detective reasoned.\n\n\"Well... does the name Savannah ring a bell?\" Winston asked, trying not to flinch at the sudden stiffness that came over Sophia's features. \"She knew you had a secret source, didn't she, Sophia?\"\n\nAgain, a pause, then a pointed glance before she finally said, \"Yes, she did... and she threatened to jeopardize the whole thing by revealing it publicly.\" The bitterness in her voice betrayed the gravity of that threat.\n\nJust as he was about to dive into that area further, he was reminded of a peculiar bit of information he'd acquired. \"Sophia, you were asked about some... scars? At a dinner party?\"\n\nSuddenly, all of Sophia's poise seemed to wither away. \"If you’re referring to the dinner at the mayor's house, yes, I was asked about them,\" she answered evasively. Then she stood up in alarm, eyes flashing with a mix of fear, defiance and something Winston couldn't quite place.\n\n\"I think this conversation is over, detective. Thank you for your time,\" were her words before she exited the room hastily.\n\nWinston sighed, shoving his hands in his pockets. The chapter with Sophia wasn't over yet. Not by a long shot. He admired her relentless pursuit of the truth, of not dodging or lying.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Sophia\nB.

His attention fell onto a single name: Justin.\n\nLeaning back in his chair, Winston found his thoughts weaving around Justin's profession—a piercer; an occupation requiring specific tools like needles and, in Justin's unique case, machetes.\n\nHe recalled his past dealings with Justin, particularly how he demonstrated a morose disposition after his proposal got rejected. Winston recalled the desperation in Justin's eyes as he recounted his romantic proposal to Marvin's fiancé. Unfortunately for him, the lady chose Marvin over him.\n\nJustin, who had been frequenting Marvin's hockey games, was there again for the scheduled match. When he arrived, he found Justin waiting amidst the empty seats.\n\n\"You watched Marvin's hockey game frequently, yeah?\" Winston began, staring up at Justin with a curiosity that was intense. Justin's face distorted with pain as he gave a nod in affirmation, silently communicating his reasons for being there the day of the murder.\n\nWinston shifted on his feet and continued, \"You were here that day, weren’t you? To watch Marvin play?\"\n\n\"I came to watch the game, like always. It was just unfortunate what happened,\" Justin replied, his voice empty of any emotion.\n\nWinston took a moment before continuing, \"I have full CCTV footage of you entering the rink at the time of Marvin's scheduled game, and not leaving until an hour after the murder was supposedly committed.\" \n\nPulling out a photo of a distinct, ornate machete from his coat pocket, he asked: \"Recognize this? CCTV also shows you carrying a bag into the rink of such size and shape, which could've carried this. And forensics confirmed that this machete, with your piercing studio's distinct engravings, was the murder weapon.\"\n\nJustin's eyes widened as truthful recognition flashed in them. Winston's next visit would be Justin's piercing parlor.\n\nJustin's piercing studio was like an alternate world. Display cases filled with shiny replicas of machetes were fixed on the walls; a reminder of his unique craft. An odd weapon for a piercer, but it seems it had become Justin's tool of choice. Upon inquiring the staff, he found that only Justin handled these machetes. Furthermore, no other employee had access to them.\n\nHis next stop was to Marvin's fiancé, a delicate woman, embodying sorrow and distraught. \n\n\"Justin approached you about not marrying Marvin, didn’t he?\" Winston struck a direct chord, to which she only nodded, tears welling up in her eyes.\n\nFollowing the tiring day of investigation, Winston drove back to the precinct. Entering the rink at the time Marvin was scheduled to play, Justin's presence at the murder site, his connection with the weapon, his relations with the victim and Marvin's fiancé - all confirmed by CCTV and forensic evidence, he had gathered ample information. Now, it was time to piece it all together.\n\nThe biting chill at the crime scene did nothing to alleviate the morbid spectacle in front of Winston. Marvin's body, brutally murdered with a machete and left on the icy, hockey rink made for an astonishing scene. \n\nMarvin was no saint though. Rumors of his volatile behavior had circulated around town for quite some time.\n\nHaving gone through the initial inspection of the crime scene, Winston decided to pay Frederick a visit at his spacious residence next to the cemetery. The presence of Frederick's numerous antique machetes at the crime scene was too much of a coincidence to ignore. The man had far too many in his collection for it to go unnoticed. Frederick, in his role as the curator of the local weapons museum, had unrestricted access to a range of armaments. And curiously, Marvin had been killed with a weapon from Frederick's extensive collection.\n\nUpon reaching the house, Winston noticed Frederick fitting the key into the lock of the cemetery gate, signifying his unrestricted access to the nearby graveyard. \n\nAs he walked up to the front porch, he noticed an ominous array of mourning books displayed on a nearby table. He asked about them and Frederick proudly claimed them to be a part of his vast collection documenting rituals from many different cultures.\n\nUpon greeting Frederick, he was immediately shown inside by Frederick's anxious daughter. She was noticeably shaken up from hearing of Marvin's murder, considering that Marvin had recently publicly threatened her. \n\nUpon hearing that, Frederick's reaction was expected. He was an incredibly protective father and the news visibly upset him. \n\nFrederick, seeming desperate to change the topic started talking about his travels, elaborating how he was tasked with visiting and studying the weapons and tombs of ancient cultures.\n\nSensing Frederick's discomfort, Winston decided to leave the conversation there. He observed his surroundings one final time before thanking them for their hospitality and reminding them to stay safe.\n\nAs he strolled back to his car, he noted the machete from Frederick's collection stationed in the museum, something he had been specifically overseeing.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The crime scene, a spectacle of spinning lights and eerie electronic music, was an unlikely backdrop for the gruesome scene laid before him. He watched as his team meticulously gathered evidence, his thoughts drifting towards the impending investigation.\n\nLater, Winston found himself in the interrogation room across from Erika, the woman who was not only Nelson's companion on the day of his demise, but his travel companion for various journeys as well. Erika appeared distressed but managed to meet Winston's gaze.\n\n\"Feeling okay?\" He began with a simple question, hoping to ease her into the conversation.\n\n“Honestly, I don't know if I can survive this loft confinement, let alone prison\" Erika's laugh came out dry and nervous, her deep-seated fear of prison evident in her statement.\n\nIgnoring her comment, Winston probed further. \"Erika, we found threatening messages from Nelson on your phone. He sounded angry. Was he?\"\n\nErika nodded meekly, \"Yes, he was... threatening to expose my past…” her voice trailed off.\n\n\"Incriminating evidence, perhaps?\" Winston asked gently, implying the criminal past Nelson threatened to expose. \n\nErika looked Winston in the eyes, \"Yes, he was... he had something over me.\"\n\nShifting the topic, Winston questioned, \"So, you two entered the arena together?\"\n\n\"Yes, we did,\" Erika answered promptly, \"Immediately, before the game started, I happened to notice a toolbox near the entrance. Strangely, there was an axe in it.\"\n\n\"You saw the axe?\" Winston asked, eyebrows knitting together in surprise.\n\n\"I did,\" Erika answered, \"I was a champion lumberjack, you know. A veteran of numerous competitions, exhibiting high axe-wielding skills. Never expected to see one in a place like this, though.\"\n\n\"A champion lumberjack?\" Winston repeated, \"That's an interesting profession.\"\n\n\"Prior to my travel gigs with Nelson, yes. I was quite good at axe-wielding. Those were a grueling couple of years,\" Erika replied.\n\nBut the clock was ticking, and Winston couldn't afford to delve into the suspect's past occupations. His only job now is to zero in on every detail around Nelson's untimely death, which occurred just minutes after they had entered the arena.\n\nWinston left the room, jotting down his notes, and wondered, how did such an innocent game of laser tag turn deadly in mere minutes? He had a long night ahead.\n\nWinston sat shoeless at the police station, his thoughts teaming with the heinous details of Nelson's murder. A few key points prodded at his focus, one of them being the placement of the body in a secluded area of the laser tag arena, an area Mackenzie was seen entering right before the murder.\n\nFirst on his interview list for the day was Mackenzie, a seemingly harmless passenger until now, who just so happened to know of these tucked-away spots in the laser tag stalls due to her numerous visits there.\n\nThere were murmurs that she and Nelson had been opponents in a game right before the unfortunate event. It was also known that her artwork, particularly her realistic depiction of blood; its colour, its texture, drew attention and praise from fellow artists. Winston tied his shoes, collected his notes, and made his way to questioning.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Mackenzie,\" Winston greeted in his best attempt at a soothing tone. \"May we discuss what happened on the day of the incident? We know you were playing laser tag with Nelson and were seen entering the secluded areas earlier.\"\n\n\"Ah. Yes. That day... I found refuge in the labyrinth area; it gave me a strategic edge. Not much of a gamer, detective?\" Mackenzie asked, a coolness to her voice. She was known in the police station for the precise recreation of the color and texture of blood in her artworks that had won several art competitions, and had received accolades from fellow artists for it.\n\n\"Not often,\" Winston admitted, pausing to jot down a note. \n\nMackenzie's composure was unnerving, especially given that she spends her free time in the morgue for... artistic inspiration. Moreover, despite her layoffs from the company and huge bills, her recent massive cash deposits and luxurious lifestyle way beyond her current earnings, were too suspicious to be ignored.\n\n\"I hear you've had quite the success in the art industry? Winning several art contests with your death scenes?\" Winston approached the topic, keeping an even tone. \"Other artists have been quite vocal in their admiration of your renditions of blood in your artwork.\"\n\n\"Seems you've been enjoying a lifestyle most can dream of but a lifestyle that doesn't match your means.\"  \n\n\"I make do,\" Mackenzie admitted with a shrug. \"My art touches people, moves them. They appreciate my talent. Pays the bills and then some. In fact, I've recently made a few hefty deposits.\"\n\n\"Nelson, he was an auditor at your organization, wasn't he? We know he was investigating suspicious transactions in the company books, were you aware of that?\" \n\n\"No, not until the company memo following his... demise,\" said Mackenzie, her voice barely wavering.\n\nWinston nodded, noting her response. It was time for him to wrap up.\n\n\"I see,\" he stated, standing to leave. \"I believe that concludes our interview for now Ms. Mackenzie. Thank you for your time.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, detective,\" Mackenzie replied with a polite nod, her dark eyes unreadable.\n\nWinston exited the meeting, his mind spinning with the given insights, and a long night of questionably solvable puzzles ahead.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Richard’s face was absorbed in the glow of the paused true crime documentary, his eyes reflecting morbid fascination and intense concentration. \n\n\"Richard?\" Winston called out, cutting through the gloomy silence, drawing the man's attention away from the screen. The detective's brows furrowed curiously at the patterned sweat marks on Richard's shirt, as well as abrasions on his hand.\n\n\"Just finishing up your work-out?\" Winston asked, gesturing towards the sweat-soaked shirt.\n\n\"Ah, yes, detective,\" Richard confessed, catching on to his implication. \"Those marks? I was practicing my nunchaku techniques in the martial arts class before you arrived. Quite challenging to get the swings right. Purchased these nunchaku from a sports equipment store last month. It's part of my martial arts training.\"\n\n\"Martial arts? I wouldn’t have expected that from a waiter,\" Winston said, conversing readily.\n\n\"The mosque I work at, it's next to this martial arts institution. We do nunchaku training as part of our drills. Isabella, tragically enough, was also a part of the same class, and I just like keeping myself engaged.\" Richard shrugged.\n\n\"Speaking of keeping engaged,\" Winston glanced towards the paused documentary on the laptop, \"Looks like you've got quite the fascination with true crime, huh?\"\n\n\"I listen, rewind, analyze, and repeat...\" Richard said, reaching towards his notebook that lay next to the computer, brimming with his own investigation strategies, \"I write down interesting details. I find it... intriguing, to say the least.\"\n\n\"Ah, a keen observer. Useful in a job like yours,\" Winston said, nodding in understanding. \n\n\"I rarely interact with anyone outside my working hours, detective,\" Richard asserted with a hint of defensiveness, immediately finishing off his sentence. \"The day the tragedy happened, I was at the martial arts class first, then I went to the mosque...but I was alone.\"\n\nThe glint in Richard's eyes gave away nothing, but Winston saw the flicker of insight deepen. With a curt nod, he stood up, leaving Richard in the expanse of his own silence. As the day drew to a close, Winston had to acknowledge one thing - Richard was an enigma, much like the case he found himself entangled in.\n\nDetective Winston was having one hell of a day, nursing a mug of coffee that had long since turned cold with the reports strewn about on his desk. \n\nA crime was reported, suspicious activity by a local hairdresser named Malaysia, notorious for her volatile behavior. Some customers claimed to see her practicing martial arts in the salon in her free time. Malaysia was also often seen at home practicing her martial arts moves and had even purchased a pair of nunchaku. She had a fondness for martial arts revered from her high school days when she attended martial arts classes. She was a fervent admirer of martial arts movies, and supposedly sought to bring some of those electrifying martial arts stunts to life.\n\nOn the day of the crime, Malaysia was not on her workplace's schedule. This was a detail that leaped out of her shoddy alibi. Noting her erratic behavior, a lady named Isabella had found it suspicious. She even reported her concerns to the authorities.\n\nWith this lead in hand, Winston headed towards Malaysia’s place. A variety of martial arts equipment arranged delicately welcomed him, including the purchased pair of nunchaku, the kind usually bought by hardcore martial arts supporters and fighters. \n\nA gentle voice pulled him back from his thoughts when Malaysia invited him inside. It turned out that martial arts was more than just a hobby for her; it was embedded in every crevice of her life.  Interestingly, she mentioned visiting a nearby mosque, which she had loved since childhood. She had always frequented the mosque, participating in various volunteering activities and contributing to its well-being.\n\nIn the middle of their conversation, a couple of police officers joining them, interrogating Malaysia about a theft. The stolen items were eventually found in her possession, which made Winston arch an eyebrow, but he said nothing.\n\nThe same mosque was the place where Isabella, the one who had noticed and reported Malaysia’s suspicious behavior, was murdered. \n\nWinston stood silently, observing Malaysia during the conversation, before excusing himself from her apartment and returning to his office. His coffee was still tepid and the files hadn’t moved, but somehow, he saw the case from a different perspective.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Malaysia\nB.

He sighed, dipping under the awning and pushing open the heavy door. The dusky light spilling over worn floorboards greeted him, along with the riotous cacophony of live music. Eddie’s talent was known, not just as a musician but also for the dazzling machete tricks he had honed and perfected during numerous camping trips. Eddie had mentioned to Winston in their prior encounters how he relied on the machete for safety during these trips, and in the quiet evenings that followed, he would practice for his performances with it.\n\nHis gaze fell upon the figure of Eddie strumming his guitar on the small stage. The song ended and the crowd went wild with applause. As Eddie bowed, his eyes locked with Winston's. Recognizing the weathered detective, Eddie excused himself from the eager gathering of fans and beckoned him over. \n\n“Detective,” Eddie said, quelling the enthusiasm in his tone. \n\n“Glad to see you can take time away from your practice,” Winston said casually.\n\n\"I've got no other pressing engagements at the moment,\" Eddie replied. \"This studio is away from my home. I like to keep my life separate. With no other roles or tasks, I spend my nights here working on my music and machete art. And when I'm not here, I'm out in the wilderness, camping.\"\n\nWinston moved on. \" I heard from Letti, she’d invited you for a song recording at her isolated mountain cabin, which you're staying at for the duration of the recording.\"\n\nEddie nodded. “Yes, it was a wonderful opportunity. Her mountain cabin is beautifully isolated, which makes it an inspiring place especially when you're used to the solitude of camping.”\n\n\"I heard you're someone who enjoys a robust collection of wildlife taxidermy,\" Winston shifted the topic.\n\nEddie’s face lit up, “Yes, I’ve got a whole room full of specimens at my place, even from endangered species. Interesting how life becomes art with death.”\n\nThe interview was interrupted by a growing chorus of fans demanding another performance. Eddie nodded to Winston, picked up his machete, and slipped away. The very same machete he used during his camping trips for safety, now became a prop in his spectacle. He showed the audience his machete tricks, with cheers accompanying each swift, practiced movement.\n\nWinston withdrew from the place, drowned out by the cheering crowd. He left for the isolation of the night, knowing that his work here wasn't nearly done.\n\nWinston pondered over the details of the case. The victim, Letti, had shared with friends about finding documents that implicated her godmother, Delilah, in illicit activities. She had even voiced her intent to go public, starting with confronting Delilah directly. Witnesses reported the last time anyone saw her, it was when Letti walked right into Delilah's cabin with an unflinching resolve. That forced his hand, leading him straight to Delilah's secluded dwelling.\n\nPerched in a rural area with few other houses for company, the cabin was nestled within a copse of trees. As he approached, he saw Delilah outside. Delilah, who was the sole occupant of the cabin known to neighbours, was regularly seen practising with a machete for security purposes. True to the reports, there she was, swinging the machete with a practiced flair, the sun igniting its path before it landed in the trunk of a tree, vibrating under the force of her strike. Even a novice could tell she was someone who knew her way around a blade.\n\nHaving verified her identity, Winston started his interrogation casually, focusing on her peculiar hobby. The queries were about her familiarity with the machete and how she had become so skilled. Delilah responded, her accent echoing with local tones, \"I've been using a machete since I was a teenager.\" She continued, reliving her past, \"Father taught me. I've won a few of the local competitions, too. Helps living alone out here, one needs to keep sharp.\"\n\nWinston noted down her history with the weapon and the regular practise for security. He then moved on to discuss Letti. \"Did Letti come here often?\" he asked.\n\nShe confirmed, \"Letti did come often, yes. The last time she came was yesterday.\" Her face revealed a shift in emotion, recognising the motive behind Winston's questioning. Being keen, he paid heed but continued to be nonchalant.\n\nHe then prodded about her lifestyle. \"You live all alone out here?\"\n\nWith a nod, Delilah confirmed the solitary lifestyle as she retrieved her machete from the tree. Winston, in the following silence, surveyed the lush woodland around the cabin — offering privacy and seclusion. They marked a stark dichotomy between peace and potential criminal activity within an authoritarian mind like him.\n\nTrying to read any hint of reaction, he brought up Letti's concern. \"Your goddaughter,\" Winston started, \"She was worried about you. She found some documents and directly confronted you about some suspicious activities. She even threatened to make it public.\"\n\nDelilah went rigid, her gaze darting toward the cabin. Her cabin – Letti's statements to her friends made it clear. Winston caught the twitch in her eyes but decided not to press further. His main inquiries were done, and the cloak of night began to envelop the landscape. However, he didn't leave empty-handed. The information gleaned from Delilah filled in gaps of Letti's allegations, driving him closer to the incident's truth on the fateful night. They also confirmed that apart from Letti and Delilah, there was no one else reported at the cabin that night.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Delilah\nB.

She wore the hardened expression of a seasoned miner, and a sprinkle of white dust beaded her forehead. She had, years ago, spent a considerable amount of time underground before she traded the pickaxe for a ring. Even after her marriage, however, Winston knew that Marianne was not unfamiliar with the heft and purpose of such a tool.\n\nHis eyes consisted of the audit papers laid out before him, declaring a significant debt that Marianne owed in back taxes. She was circling financial demise, and the state was closing in. Then, his eyes shifted to the statement provided by a friend of hers, highlighting her strong assertion that she would rather perish than get sent behind bars. It seemed to Winston that Marianne was still filled with the spirits of the old miners, willing to risk it all in pursuit of her own freedom.\n\nHis venture out to her parcel of land a few days back had stamped the image in his mind of her mining tools lounging out in the open. They were well-kept and clean, the way old miners kept their tools. Marianne had been spotted around the community with the pickaxe, using it for various garden works and general maintenance.\n\nNow Winston's attention moved to Wendy, the victim, an honest lady known for her earnest ways. She was found in a sequestered section of the roller rink, a roller skate still hanging onto her foot as if she was frozen mid-skate.\n\nPlacing a call, Winston requested the CCTV footage of the roller rink from the night of the murder. There, in the flickering low resolution, was Wendy locked in a heated argument with Marianne. The dispute ended and Wendy skated off, but Marianne stayed.\n\nLater, another clip showed Marianne lingering along the outskirts, long after the other skaters had left. It was an eerie sight - the roller rink was empty, except for the flickering neon lights and Marianne, circling the rink with an unsettling calmness.\n\nWinston slid an envelope towards himself and carefully extracted a photograph. It was Wendy's last piece of brave detective work - a picture of Marianne caught in a grim action that served as undeniable proof of her crime. But it was Wendy, with her unwavering integrity, who held this tight to her chest, vowing to expose the truth about Marianne.\n\nTwo cups of coffee empty, Winston switched off the lights and left the room. The image of Marianne and the pickaxe lingered in the darkness of the office, the unsaid words and whispers of the CCTV footage bouncing off the walls. The unwelcome truth seemed to have found a perfect partner with the impending dawn, unflinching and relentless.\n\nAs Winston flipped through the case file, his eyes landed on a photo of the crime scene. His heart ached slightly for the young woman, Wendy, brutally murdered at the roller rink. The weapon of choice: a pickaxe. Not something you would typically see at a roller rink.\n\nEntering the rink, Winston felt a shudder creep up his spine as he glanced at the spot where Wendy's body had been found. Shaking off his unease, he made his way over to the row of lockers where the staff pointed him to Sidney's locker.\n\nIt was well known that Sidney, a local geologist, was a regular at this establishment. Even given the oddity of a geologist frequenting a roller rink, Winston was familiar enough with murder investigations to understand that people, like rocks, had layers. \n\nCasually, Winston made conversation, \"You're here a lot, I hear?\" Sidney nodded, almost dismissively, not yet prepared to show his hand. \"I heard you often chat about your friend Jack, is that right?\" Sidney nodded again, this time more cautiously.\n\n\"I find skating to be a wonderful escapism,\" Sidney murmured, while scanning the rink with a haunted look. His guard dropped slightly as he added, \"And Jack...well, you know about Jack and his troubles.\"\n\nFrom an interrogation room in the local precinct, Jack, a known criminal and Sidney's friend, gazed at Winston. Already serving time, he had nothing to lose by divulging information. As Sidney’s name left Winston's lips, Jack's eyes grew wide.\n\n\"He's a letter writer, you know. Always has been,\" Jack offered, unprompted. Winston thought curiously about the possible relevance of this. Jack continued, now with a dropped voice, \"He cherishes the art of placing words on paper.\"\n\nCaught off guard by the reverence in Jack's words, Winston's attention piqued at the news that Sidney was a common pen pal.\n\nAt the roller rink office, Sidney's tormented expression flitted across the screen of the surveillance camera footage. There he was with Wendy, both laughing and skating. The timestamp below the image – the night of Wendy’s death. As the staff had mentioned, Sidney’s presence during the hours coinciding with the murder fit. There was little doubt that he had been in the vicinity.\n\nWinston packed his notepad away and left for Sidney's apartment. There, the detective found an abundance of stamps and stationary stacked neatly by the desk. A typewriter nearby indicated an air of old-school character. Jack's words suddenly resurfaced. Scanning the room again, Winston spotted a picture of Wendy. Beside it, a letter with Sidney's handwriting.\n\nHands in his slick black overcoat pockets, Winston glanced around the roller rink one last time before leaving. Stopping at the doorway, he turned around to Sidney, opening his mouth to say something before deciding against it. Winston remembered their previous conversation. \"I have no idea what Wendy was talking about,\" Sidney had said defiantly when confronted with the secret Wendy had been spreading about him.\n\nSuddenly, Winston remembered what he had heard in side conversations with Wendy's friends. The secret she knew wasn't just ruinous; it was humiliating. She knew something that, once revealed, would publicly disgrace Sidney. \n                    \nWith a sigh, he discarded the thought and walked out into the chill of the evening. His mind buzzed with unanswered questions. There was more to this case. More to Sidney. More to Wendy. To think it all revolved around a roller rink. He'll crack it open, he always does.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Marianne\nB.

She sat nervously behind her desk, strands of red hair falling into her face as she busied herself with hastily checking the details of an upcoming event on her computer. \n\n\"Ms. Xenia, I'm detective Winston\", he introduced himself and continued with the reason for his visit, \"I have questions about the wedding you had planned for Charlotte.\"\n\nXenia paused and nodded, \"It was going to be one of a kind, you see, it had a rustic theme.\"\n\n\"And would that require distinctive materials for decoration?” Winston asked casually.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Xenia replied, beginning to look a little more at ease. \"Every event is a reflection of the couple getting married. For Charlotte and her groom, I purchased and suggested burlap, barn wood, mason jars... and barbed wire, of course.\"\n\nWinston changed the topic, \"The wedding was scheduled to happen around the time of Charlotte's murder at the same venue. As the wedding planner, you must have been there during that time.\"\n\nIt was clear the question had caught Xenia off guard. “As a wedding planner, I need to manage all the details and stay at the event location from the setup until the breakdown of the decorations. That's just part of the job,\" she explained, looking a bit flushed.\n\n“You've been in this business for quite some time, your reputation is built on trust, isn't it?\" Winston inquired.\n\n\"I've worked very hard to establish my business,\" Xenia replied. \n\n“The wedding venue was a temple, wasn’t it?” asked Winston.\n\n“Yes, Charlotte’s wish was to get married in that temple,\" Xenia confirmed.\n\n“And Charlotte was going to confess something on her wedding day,” Winston stated plainly. \n\nThe color quickly drained from Xenia's face, \"She was going to reveal that I had advised her to keep her past relationship with my partner a secret. She threatened to ruin my relationship. She claimed she had a past with my partner, saying she was going to expose that in front of everyone at the wedding.\" Xenia's voice trembled with a mix of anger and hurt as she concluded, \"She just couldn’t let me be happy. She was going to destroy everything.\"\n\nWinston quietly absorbed everything Xenia had said. He offered a polite goodbye before standing up to leave. It was clear this case was far from resolved. “Thank you for your time,” he commented before leaving Xenia to her thoughts and the remainder of her busy day.\n\nDetective Winston was knee deep into yet another murder case. This time around, the victim was Charlotte, a member of a rival gang. It seemed to Winston, he had ended up in a crime novel where even the picturesque setting of an old temple was marred with blood and brutality. The murder weapon? Barbed wire.\n\nThe top of his suspect list was Priscilla, a hiker of some renown. She was reported to have hiked treacherous terrains like the Andes and the Himalayas. But what did that have to do with this murder?\n\nWinston made his way to one of Priscilla’s regular weekend trekking sites. He found that his observations were true: Priscilla did own all the gears required for hiking. On the trail, barbed wire fences seemed to be a sight as common as the rocks under his feet.\n\nWhile scanning her gear, he spotted something curious: a set of wire snips. Now, that was interesting. These weren't typically part of usual hiking kits. Could she be cutting the barbed wires for her personal use? He knew that Priscilla had learned a number of survival skills, barbed wire defense being on the list.\n\nNext, Winston took note of her tattoos, typical symbols jauntily drawn across her arms that were familiar heraldry of one gang or another. Police records confirmed it: Priscilla was no stranger to gang activities. \n\nAs Winston dug deeper into Priscilla's hiking expeditions, he realized these weren't just pleasure trips. Spanning the Andes to the Himalayas, Priscilla put herself through some of the world's most treacherous terrains.\n\n\"Priscilla, you hike here every weekend, don’t you?\" Winston asked when he had a chance to confront her.\n\n\"Yes, sir. It's my escape,\" Priscilla replied, a subtle glint in her eyes.\n\n\"Interesting choice of gear you have there.\"\n\n\"Every item here is vital for my survival,\" she retorted as she turned her gaze away from him.\n\n\"Even the wire cutters?\" he pushed. She scoffed, shrugging her shoulders and moved away from his watchful eye.\n\nWinston watched her walk away, he needed to iron out the creases in this case, pondering his next move.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

It was a modest mountain retreat, now stained with the unfortunate memory of Russell’s demise. Lloyd was sitting on the dusty sofa, a faraway look in his eyes and a heavy book about the occult in his lap. Lloyd was known to read such books often, his bandmates even joking that it contributed to their lyrical themes. As Winston looked at him, the air surrounding Lloyd stirred with tension, a kind one would expect from a man who had just tragically lost his bandmate.\n\nLloyd and Russell... Band members for the past few years, and their music wasn’t what you’d call the uplifting kind. His band was popular in the death metal genre, filled with Lloyd's often mentioned themes of death and beyond. It sits quite well with Lloyd who, per his bandmates, always had a knack for such dark subject matters and the occult.\n\n“What brings you up here Lloyd?” Winston asked, his gaze surveying the quiet tension in the room.\n\n“Russ invited me,” Lloyd cleared his throat. “We were supposed to spend the weekend here, just chillin’, you know?”\n\nThe realization crept up on Winston that Lloyd had been the only guest of the cabin. No one else was present at the time of the murder.\n\n“Russell had…had something to discuss,” Lloyd continued, his voice wavering.\n\nWinston recalled that Russell was apparently threatening to disclose some letters containing information of Lloyd’s past drug addiction. Furthermore, the letters were companioned with an ultimatum. If Lloyd didn't step down from the band, Russell would reveal his secret. Lloyd had confided in Winston once before, worried Russell would spill everything to the band.\n\n\"Russell knew about your past... about your struggles?” Winston asked, without directly hinting at the letters.\n\nLloyd hesitated, \"Yeah...he did.\"\n\nPerhaps sensing a pinch of confrontation, Lloyd was quick to confirm his acceptance of the invitation and his purpose of being in the cabin.\n\n“Look, I am not hiding anything. I was right here,” Lloyd admitted, his face pale in the stark cabin light.\n\nWinston listened to Lloyd's confession, his mind quietly synchronizing the timelines.\n\nAs Winston walked away from the cabin, he came across the morgue. The snowy mountains encased the building. Like the cabin, it was isolated, yet unique in its way. Its excellent acoustics, a common rumor among locals, made it an odd, yet curious spot to echo death metal tracks, much like the ones made by Lloyd and Russell.\n\nThe morgue assistant, however, had an odd compliment attached to it. \"Did you know, this place has amazing acoustics,” he called out to Winston, “people often say it's just perfect for music.” \n\nWinston merely nodded, saying nothing, his mind racing to connect the dots.\n\nDetective Winston, fresh off a long shift, pulled up to the cabin site. The cool mountain air was a welcome respite from the city grime. The cabin had belonged to Naomi's parents, Winston had learned, and he could see why they'd chosen this spot. An idyllic view of alpine tranquillity, now marred by a heinous act.\n\nHe'd met with Naomi earlier that day - a small-framed woman with a practiced smile that didn't quite reach her wary eyes. She had been seen digging in her garden on the very day before the murder, commencing a new gardening project at her home. Winston mused that it must be therapeutic, gardening. He contemplated this as he eyed the various tools casually strewn about her property - a shovel, now identified as the murder weapon, amongst them.\n\nWhen he asked her about the murder of Russell, her lips had become thin. \"'Course I saw him,\" she admitted. \"I invited him up here for the weekend, we spent the very day of the murder together. Couldn't very well ignore my own son, could I?\" There was something somber about her tone. Something layered with sorrow and maybe regret. \n\nWinston pressed on. \"I heard Russell had found something in your possession. Something... illegal?\"\n\nNaomi dropped her gaze momentarily. \"Spent a lot of idle chatter, doesn't it?\" \n\nLater, Winston visited the site of the garden patch Naomi had mentioned. It was new indeed. Thorough, too. Naomi knew her stuff. When he asked the neighbors, they confirmed that Naomi had been at the cabin alone that weekend, until Russell visited her on the exact day of the murder.\n\nWinston tried not to think about why Naomi was so desperate to avoid prison. Russell had known about her criminal activity, he remembered. And Russell didn't just suspect her, he had documented evidence that could've incriminated his mother. Something he couldn't ignore. All Winston could hope to do now was find it.\n\nMurder weapon, a shovel. Mother as a suspect. A garden, a cabin, and a son who potentially knew too much. Winston turned these facts over in his mind, the cool mountain air chilling his senses, making his next moves all too clear.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Naomi\nB.

Lloyd, a local musician, and past resident of the rehab centers spread across the state, had been called in for questioning about the murder of Russell.\n\nAfter a couple of moments, the door creaked open and in stepped Lloyd, his eyes darting round the dull police office. His lips were tightly closed, not to emit any nervous chuckles that might belittle his present state.\n\n\"You're Lloyd?\" Winston asked, giving the man a scrutinizing look as he sipped his bitter coffee. \"Yes, sir...\" Lloyd replied, his voice barely above a whisper. Winston sighed and motioned for him to sit down.\n\nFrom Winston's vantage, there was nothing extraordinary about him. Lloyd distinctly bore an air of normalcy, with nothing damning about him--except, perhaps, the recent discovery of a shovel in the car he'd apparently been spotted outside a local hardware store with. His friends had vouched for him, saying that carrying a shovel made sense given his past in landscaping, but those could easily be false confirmations. \"What's a musician doing with a shovel in his car?\" Winston mused aloud.\n\n\"Oh, that..\" Lloyd shifted, seeming almost proud. \"That comes from my past, you see. Been involved in many a landscaping project. Old habits hardly die, I guess.\"\n\nWinston nodded, his eyes not leaving Lloyd as he mentioned Russell. \"Apparently, you were with Russell up at that mountainside cabin, weren't ya?\" Lloyd swallowed audibly, then nodded.\n\n\"I... I was.\" Lloyd confirmed. \"He invited me for a weekend. I accepted and stayed there, sir.\"\n\n\"And do you happen to remember if there was anyone else there?\" Winston's question pierced the room.\n\n\"No, sir. Just Russell and me. No one else.\" Lloyd's voice shook slightly, drenched in anxiety.\n\nWinston shifted the focus of the conversation, his eyes zeroing on a batch of letters. \"Russell was threatening to disclose these letters, wasn't he? He would expose your drug addiction to the band if you didn't step down,\" he probed, shuffling the documents as Lloyd's face turned pale.\n\n\"I couldn't let him tell the band... I fought so hard to keep that past behind,\" Lloyd murmured. \"Those letters... they held my life's biggest regrets.\"\n\nWith that, Lloyd's confession was done. Winston felt a curious sense of unease existing in the otherwise silent room featuring the exhausted and quite possibly vulnerable Lloyd. Silently, his eyes followed Lloyd out of his office and felt the chill of the mountain cabin travel all the way down to his city office.\n\nWinston cranked the heater in his car as he parked in front of the police station. He couldn't shake off the cold chill of the mountain crime scene. Russell, another good man gone too soon.\n\nReminiscing over evidence photos, he couldn’t help but eye the shovel. There it was, the suspected murder weapon itself. Unforeseen, such an everyday tool, now stained with malice.\n\nPulling up security camera footage on his laptop, he saw Naomi, Russell’s mother, digging in her garden. The timestamp indicated it was just the day before Russell’s murder. Winston made a mental note; Naomi had started a new gardening project at her home recently. The last thing Russell saw might have been rather ironic for him - the very shovel he used to help dig holes for his mother's flowers. \n\nThe next morning after grabbing a coffee to go, Winston pulled up to Naomi’s house. \n\n“Detective Winston, how are you?” Naomi asked letting him inside.\n\n“Morning, Ma’am. I’m here about Russell.” He replied, trying meticulously hard not to let his empathy show in his voice. \n\n“Yes, I thought as much,” She responded and motioned an invitation to sit down.\n\nOver coffee, Winston learned about Naomi's recent solitary hobbies. She told him about spending afternoons in the local park. Her neighbor had reported her midnight walks to the police. And her recent shunning of social events. Odd behavior, he debated, for a woman who just lost her son. Also noted her hands hardened and calloused from vigorous gardening work, reminded him of the footage.\n\n“Russell came by the cabin last weekend. I had inherited it from my parents and was there alone all weekend. I had invited him over…” Her voice dropped, “And then I found him. Evidently when I was gardening...”\n\nHer words hung in the air. Winston finished his coffee and excused himself. Time to go meet with her neighbor, perhaps they noticed something Naomi missed.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The high ceilings, hung with bolts of fabric in every imaginable hue, touched upon the unique operation run within these walls. Winston squinted against the gleaming steel fixtures and sharp angles of modern decor. Models stood like long-legged statues, being prodded, pinned, and fussed over by diligent seamstresses, while students on internship from nearby colleges, huddled together over laptops and design sketches near an overflowing rubbish bin. \n\nSuddenly, Winston caught sight of live security footage from a group of local colleges. All of them were pointed at Emma's studio, and all seemed to be focused on the same event, Emma abruptly closing her computer. Curious, he viewing the footage retrospectively, and, indeed, she had closed her computer abruptly several times in the past days.\n\nShe appeared from a curtained alcove at the back of the space, shutting her laptop abruptly once more as she noticed the detective’s arrival. Emma, fashion designer extraordinaire. \n\n\"Why the visit, Winston?\" Her nonchalant tone betrayed a perplexing mix of audacity and unease. \n\n\"Just following up on some loose ends,\" he replied, his gaze trained on the computer she just closed and the designs she was now carrying in her arms. He asked to see them. \n\nEmma shuffled nervously and hurriedly tucked them back in her bag.\n\n\"I hear you've been working late nights recently,\" He said, attempting to keep the conversation flowing casually. \"Your neighbors mentioned seeing your studio lights on until the early hours.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you know us designers. Night is when the inspiration hits.\"\n\nHer assistant, a young woman with dyed hair, glanced up and gave her a guarded look before quickly shutting her laptop. Winston noticed, but moved on.\n\n\"I understand you were at Stella's house today. For a fitting in her kitchen, I believe?\"\n\nEmma nodded, her eyes flicking to the two college interns hunched over a laptop nearby who abruptly closed their devices and busied themselves with the tasks before them.\n\n\"She liked her fittings at home. Something about the comfort of her own kitchen,\" Emma said with a distant gaze.\n\n\"Yes. Odd place to hold a fitting, a kitchen. Odd place to find her too.\" The silence hung in the air like lead. \"Have you been accused of plagiarism recently?\"\n\nThe question felt sudden, but Emma's reaction was more telling. \n\n\"Well...yes, Stella thought I was copying her designs. Stella found my sketches of her upcoming collection when she was at my studio last. She thought I had stolen them, but it was a misunderstanding. She threatened to expose me, but I didn't--\"\n\n\"Odd,\" Winston interrupted. \"She told me she found something hidden in your studio. Pages from a sketchbook, designs that looked remarkably like her unreleased collection.\" \n\nEmma was quiet. Winston continued, \"Stella was alone in her kitchen most mornings. And that's where she found herself this morning.\"\n\nEmma said nothing. \n\nThe hum of sewing machines filled the room. Winston turned to walk away but paused, \"One final thing, Emma, your business relies heavily on the internet, right?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's common these days.\"\n\n\"Mmm. Might want to be careful what you leave open on your computers around here. I saw the way your assistant and the college interns noticed when you abruptly closed your browser.\" \n\nWith that, Winston spun on his heel, and strode out of the bustling workspace leaving one very worried fashion designer behind.\n\nWinston took a deep breath before ringing the bell on the townhouse's front door. Milton graciously accepted the detective into his home and offered him a seat in the sitting room. Gathering his thoughts, Winston began his informal interview.\n\n\"Milton, it is my understanding that you were at Stella's for dinner on the night of the murder, which took place in her kitchen. Is that correct?\"\n\nMilton nodded, “Yes, that's correct. I used to visit her quite often for dinner. She was a dear friend of mine,”.\n\nWinston could detect slight distress in his voice and a gentleness in his eyes. He decided to switch topics. \n\n\"I hear you’re quite the chemist?\"\n\nMilton, relieved by the change of conversation, brightened. \"Yes, I've been practicing chemistry for a few decades now. I really enjoy it, makes understanding the world around us a bit easier.\"\n\nWinston's attention shifted momentarily to a picture frame on a nearby bookshelf; Milton in a martial arts uniform, multiple medals hanging around his neck. He picked it up and inquired. \n\n\"I see you're into martial arts too. Do you train often?\" \n\nMilton smiled at the fond memory, \"Ah, yes. I train regularly. For about fifteen years now. Got me a certification too. Helps keep the mind and body balanced you know.”\n\nWinston, not noticing Milton's boast about his certification, continued to explore the room with his eyes. On a small table by the window, he spotted a pair of nunchaku. \n\n\"Martial arts, eh?\" Winston held up the nunchaku, Milton watched with a knowing smile.\n\n\"Yes, nunchaku is an essential part of martial arts, I practice with those regularly.”\n\nA moment of silence endured with only the weather outside providing a subtle humming to the room. Winston decided it was time to tap the unspoken tension.\n\n\"And Milton…,\" Winston leaned forward, \"You were aware that Stella had discovered concrete evidence and was planning to expose your fraudulent practices in your work, weren’t you?\"\n\nMilton swallowed audibly before answering. \"Yes, Stella had found concrete evidence of my unethical practices at work which she didn’t agree with, and was planning to expose me. My dear friend was indeed honorable like that…”\n\nWinston leaned back, processing this information silently. \n\nAnd without a word, Winston excused himself from the room.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

After all, she was is in high demand, even other directors wanted her, luring her with offers. Yet with loss and betrayal, her world was cut short in a wrestling ring of all places. By a halberd, an ancient weapon, now primarily a theatrical prop.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Detective Winston perused his notes. It highlighted a complex web of deceit and jealousy, one that placed Elizabeth, the director of the play, at its center. As director, she possessed keys to every corner of the premises, from mundane storage rooms to the wrestling stage utilized for rehearsals. He noted that the wrestling ring was near the storage, where the halberd used in rehearsals was kept. Throughout the rehearsal process, Elizabeth personally supervised the handling and usage of the props. The halberd, in particular, was a focal point of the performance.\n\nHis mind swarmed back to the crime scene, the wrestling ring...currently cordoned off with police tape. Eleanor's lifeless body sprawled under the unforgiving ring lights.\n\nEarlier, Elizabeth was overseeing the wrestling rehearsals. At one point, she had asked everyone else to leave the wrestling ring area. Not long after, Eleanor was found dead. It was a shocking scene, a terrible ending to a tense day.\n\nRecalling his earlier conversation with Elizabeth, he remembered her mentioning a confrontation with Eleanor. She was upset, angry that Eleanor was having an affair with her husband. Yet Eleanor merely smirked, mocking her in front of the entire cast. It was her last act of defiance before her demise.\n\nDetective Winston looked over his notepad. There was tension, anger and the revelation of betrayal. It wasn't lost on him that Elizabeth had not only lost her star actress but was facing a personal betrayal of unforgettable proportions. He had the facts, now his job was to uncover the truth. No matter how dark or sad it may be.\n\nDetective Winston stroked his chin, hunched over the photos sprawled across his desk. The halberd lodged into Eleanor's chest had sent a chill through his spine. It wasn't every day that a wrestling ring turned murder scene with a halberd as the choice of weapon. The uniquely crafted design on the blade matched another one that he had seen before.\n\nLighting a cigarette, he recalls his conversation with the ex-husband. \"I've never seen Freya without her sunglasses, man, not since we got hitched. She was always oddly sensitive to light.\"\n\n\"But let me tell you,\" the ex-husband continued, \"when she did want to talk, she'd always insist on meeting at the park, on that bench overlooking the water. That's her style.\"\n\nWinston had been waiting to talk to Freya at her usual spot, a park bench overlooking the water, when she finally approached. She sat down gingerly, sunglasses firmly over her eyes. True to her habit, she started the conversation.\n\n\"How can I help, Detective?\" Freya kicked off the conversation, interrupting the peace offered by the chirping of birds nearby. \n\n\"No pleasantries, huh?\" Winston retorted, smoke billowing from the corner of his lips.\n\n\"What can I say, Winston? Let's get the ball rolling,\" Freya responded, avoiding his eyes. She seemed to shift uncomfortably, her gaze fixed on the passing ducks. Winston found it odd that she wouldn't make eye contact - a classic nervous trait - reminding him painfully of the ex-husband's remarks about her light sensitivity.\n\n\"You know about Eleanor's debt, right?\"\n\nFreya didn't bat an eyelid, just a sharp exhalation as she responded, \"Yeah, I loaned her money for my historical artifact collection. She knew about my illegal artifact ventures... threatened to expose me if I didn't pay her back.\"\n\nWinston blinked in surprise as he processed this information. Freya's bankruptcy declaration just last month floating to the front of his mind.\n\n\"Ahh, your historical artifacts... they wouldn't happen to include medieval weapons, would they? Like a halberd, with a similar design identical to the one used in Eleanor's murder?\"\n\nFreya's expression wrinkles as she nods, \"Yeah, I take it every fortnight for maintenance... helps keep my combat training sharp too.\"\n\nThere it was, the fact he was waiting to unravel - the halberd used in the murder was indeed identical to the one in Freya's collection.\n\nWith that, he stands, dropping his cigarette butt into a nearby bin, leaving Freya on her usual park bench, hiding behind her sunglasses.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

A home office painted with scorch marks and scars from flames, not the ordinary scene he would walk into. Mackenzie's death was indeed beyond ordinary.\n\nA local artist, Sophia, was on Winston's list for interviews. The name Sophia resonated in the art world, known for her bizarre fire-based creations. Winston remembered; the art reviews had used words like \"charred\" to describe her artwork. Moreover, he knew that she was often seen transporting flamethrowers to her studio, intriguing the townsfolk. It was said that she used these flamethrowers in her creative process.\n\nWinston found Sophia in her studio, surrounded by antiques that greatly resemble family heirlooms. But he knew this couldn't be the case as both Sophia's mother and sibling had confirmed to him that they did not have possession of any family heirlooms. Therefore, Sophia must have been purchasing these artifacts, and his suspicions were confirmed when he noticed the receipt from a local antique dealer. It was the same dealer who had mentioned that Sophia paid a high price for each item.\n\n\"Sophia?\" Winston asked, catching the attention of the artist, who had her back to him.\n\n\"Yes, that's me,\" Sophia replied, pushing her disheveled hair behind her ear. Her face was thin and pale. Dark circles hung heavy under her eyes.\n\n\"You purchase a lot of antiques, Sophia?\" Winston had noticed the receipt and the dealer's confirmation of the high prices.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" Sophia replied, casting a glance around her at the collected objects. \"They're all pretty expensive, but worth the uniqueness they bring to my art.\"\n\nWinston decided to press about a more sensitive issue. \"Mackenzie,\" he said, and Sophia's expression shifted. \"She found your stash, didn't she?\"\n\nSophia’s face paled even further. \"No comment,\" she muttered, but her jittery hands gave her away.\n\n\"I understand she had been funding your art and supporting your addiction habit...your addiction, Sophia,\" Winston added the words slipping past his lips. He revealed how Mackenzie had threatened to cut Sophia off from her art funds unless she got clean and to tell the world about Sophia's addiction if she didn't get help.\n\nSophia looked away, a flame dancing in her eyes, mirroring the charred elements in her artwork. In those eyes, Winston found a desperate artist drowning in her own addiction and, the financial torment that was coming along with it. A need for money, for drugs.\n\n\"Sophia, her threats...you did hear them, didn't you?\" Winston's voice was low.\n\nSophia, barely audible, whispered, \"I heard her.\"\n\nThe evidence was there: the futile search for family heirlooms, the expensive antiques, the thinly-veiled threats from Mackenzie, all leading towards an artist struggling with her addiction. An artist desperate for money and lost in her need for drugs.\n\n\"Thank you, Sophia,\" Winston stood from his chair, but before he left, his eyes trained on a flamethrower stored in the corner of the studio. With these parting words, he left, \"Take care of yourself, Sophia.\"\n\nAs Detective Winston entered Virgil's home gym, the smell of iron and sweat filled his nostrils. Walls lined with mirrors reflected the image of a man who spent a great deal of time building his formidable strength and size through lifting heavy weights. \n\n\"Detective,\" Virgil called out in a deep, gravelly voice, his muscular arms moving a stacked barbell with almost mechanical precision. \"Couldn't help but notice Mackenzie in your stack of files.\"\n\n\"She mentioned you helped her out around her home office. Moving heavy things and such?\" Winston questioned, observing Virgil's intense workout regime. \n\n\"Helped her plenty, Detective. Many times, she'd call needing my strength.\" He said, pausing to wipe away the sweat that trickled down his forehead. \n\n\"According to witnesses, your last visit to Mackenzie's wasn't so friendly,\" Winston remarked, his gaze intense, \"You were spotted over at Mackenzie's house on the day she was murdered.\"\n\nVirgil set down the weight he had been lifting and turned to face Winston. \"Yes, the witnesses are correct. I was at her house that day, but I swear I didn't kill her.\" He admitted.\n\nDetective Winston noticed a glass cabinet filled with an assortment of exotic weaponry. Virgil seemed to be someone who appreciated the unusual; the flamethrower that sat amidst the collection was proof of that. Winston's eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of it. \n\n\"A flamethrower,\" He pointed out. \"Not something you see every day.\"\n\nVirgil nodded, his arms crossed over his chest. \"I do have a penchant for the extraordinary.\" \n\nWinston noticed a glaring void on the trophy shelf, amidst the other varied bodybuilding accolites Virgil had accrued. Virgil followed his gaze.\n\n\"That's where my prized trophy used to sit. Winning it took an awful lot out of me...quite literally.\" Virgil's voice betrayed a hint of vulnerability. \n\n\"A piece of metal making you this emotional?\" Winston asked, looking at the bodybuilder, his brows lifted in feigned curiosity. \n\n\"Means a lot more to me than just that, Detective,\" Virgil was quick to retort, his eyes brimming with a mix of anger and sadness, \"Especially after you work hard, and the fruits of that labor are just taken away...stolen and sold off like some trinket.\"\n\n\"Mackenzie did that?\" Winston inquired, recalling from the witnesses' statements about her selling Virgil's trophy.\n\n\"Sure did, Detective. Laughed in my face about it too. Mocked me for placing such value on it.\" Virgil’s voice tightened around the final words, raw feelings evident in his gaze.\n\nWinston took a deep breath, processing all the information. \"I appreciate your honesty, Virgil. I will be on my way now.\"\n\nWith that, Detective Winston left the brawny bodybuilder standing amidst the mirrored room.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Sophia\nB.

Max ran a popular art dealership in town, claiming to deal with artifacts too, and his reputation had charmed many art enthusiasts, including Dwayne. \n\nUpon knocking, the door creaked open. Winston found himself in a large living space, filled with exquisite pieces of art, including a rather unique sickle, which was oddly intriguing.\n\n\"Max?\" Winston called out, taking care not to disturb the artifacts around him.\n\nMax returned from another room, a pleased grin on his face, his eyes kindling with pride,\" Ah, detective, welcome to my humble abode.\"\n\nMax was a known art dealer who wasn't just after profit but cherished the art of curating a meaningful collection. From Winston's observation, Max appeared to be highly concerned about his reputation in this field.\n\nWhen Winston asked, \"Did Dwayne visit you last night?”, from the corner of his eye he noticed a flicker of unease cross Max’s face. Max hesitated before answering, \"Yes, Detective. He wanted to take a look at my collection... he had a soft spot for historical farming artifacts.\"\n\nAs they chatted, Max admitted to giving Dwayne a ride afterward as Dwayne was his guest, and thought it only right to drive him back. Dwayne was seated in the passenger's seat of Max's car, he had said. It was in this same car where Dwayne's lifeless body was found later. \n\n\"So it was just the two of you going to the car?\", Winston clarified, to which Max nodded, confirming that he was last seen with Dwayne heading towards the car.\n\nAs the discussion continued, Winston learnt from Max about an upcoming exhibit, where Dwayne planned to expose an inauthentic artifact in Max's collection, something that threatened Max’s reputation.\n\nOn leaving, Winston couldn't help but echo the words of an old mentor. In a world where reputation is synonymous with one's identity, public humiliation would surely be a blow to anyone's individuality.\n\nWith that he exited, leaving a rather perturbed Max behind him, contemplating the implications.\n\nWinston found himself standing in the midst of Anthony's gallery. The room was a silent symphony of colors and emotions, none of which were gold. But gold was the color he was concerning himself with today. Anthony's housekeeper had testified that she found gold paint on his clothes after his various trips, an unusual finding considering none of his displayed art contained any hint of the metallic hue.\n\nHe stepped out to speak with the gallery owner, his heavy boots echoing slightly in the hushed rooms. \"He uses gold paint?\" Winston asked, waving a test report he had from Anthony's housekeeper.\n\n\"No, not ever in his career. Anthony's palette is more primary,\" the gallery owner stated, looking rather puzzled.\n\nAfter a short nod, Winston tucked away the paper, and left the gallery. His next stop in the long journey would be to confront Anthony himself. Anthony had earlier on requested a meeting with Dwayne. He decided to use this unusual request as leverage, he agreed now to meet Winston by Dwayne's car, a location he knew well since he had keys to it. He pulled out his phone to arrange this unusual meeting.\n\nAnthony looked a bit out of place amongst the urban landscape, amongst the shining cars. His hair was a wild mane and colors smudged his skin artistically. A keychain, bulky and jingling with keys, sat by his side. \n\n\"I had to pick up some of Dwayne's things\", Anthony said, hand unconsciously stroking the keychain. \"His woman couldn’t do it, she's a wreck.\"\n\n\"You had keys to his car?\" Winston prompted.\n\n\"Well, yes, we were friends after all,\" Anthony replied, confirming his synaptic tie to Dwayne's automobile. \n\nWinston decided to take a different approach for the kind of question that lay heavy on his mind. \"Dwayne didn't share your religious beliefs, did he?\" He said, more of a statement than a question.\n\nAnthony's face twisted, his features hardened. \"No, he didn't, the fool was way off the path. He never got my art, my sermons. I've often stated in my preachings that the nonbelievers like him were threatening the sanctity of our path.\"\n\nAnthony looked uncomfortable when he realized what he had just said, and he tried to compose himself. \"He needed help, that’s why I wanted to meet him. Sure, I was deeply offended by his criticism, but that doesn't make my concern any less valid.\"\n\n\"To convince him about your beliefs?\" Winston posed, a touch of humanity in his tone.\n\n\"No, to make him understand my art!\" Anthony's voice was emphatic. But he didn’t admit to painting with gold.\n\n\"There were disagreements then?\" Winston asked, almost rhetorically.\n\nA deep sigh rasped out from Anthony's mouth. \"Yes, often. Unfortunately, I was unable to win him over.\"\n\nHe looked down at his hands, the same hands that relentlessly splashed beautiful, and often disturbing, illusions onto canvas. And then a grim realization reflected on his face, a bitter parting comment reminding him of the deep offense Dwayne’s criticism might have caused. The open space around Dwayne's car echoed with the ringing silence-the paradoxical sound of an artist remorseful.\n\n\"Ah, it doesn’t matter now.\" Anthony got up to leave, a sad brush of reality tinted his voice.\n\nThe man was an artist, devoted to his spiritual path to the point of obsession. But enough to commit a murder? Winston wondered, the many pieces of this puzzle yet to find their right place.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Anthony\nB.

Whispers of Isolde's last moments — what had she seen, what had she felt — clung to the air, making Winston's skin cling to the white collar of his shirt. \n\nA key piece of Isolde's life had been her role in exposing medical malpractice. Video evidence, meticulously collected, strangely presented itself beyond the crime scene. She had been building a case against Samuel, a man Winston was becoming increasingly interested in. \n\nSamuel had been a paramedic, receiving intense training which even included handling emergency situations with injuries from barbed wire. The unfortunate ironic nature of his education was not lost on Winston. He was a man trained to save lives, to handle emergencies. But there had been a serious error during a previous medical procedure, an error Samuel found hard to live down. Now, he made his living in a medical supply store, trying to make up for lost time, perhaps. \n\nOne sunny Monday, Winston himself had seen Samuel, sunglasses shading his eyes, his job posing no hindrance to his apparent penchant for intrigue. Just the next day, the sunglasses had been replaced with eyeglasses. That was a curious detail — Samuel didn't have a prescription for eyewear.\n\nIntriguing, things left to ponder. \n\nAs for the barbed wire, that vile instrument's origin led back to a storage unit. Samuel had a key to said unit. Had he known about its contents? It was, after all, not a common item for city dwellers to come by. \n\nThen, there was the matter of the hair. Samuel, a typical brown-haired man, had recently been seen sporting hair as dark as the night. A local store clerk had mentioned selling black hair dye to a man fitting Samuel's description days prior. \n\nWinston remembered mutterings of a superior warning Samuel about potential job loss even jail time. The detective felt a chill run down his spine as he processed the connections. \n\nA visit to Samuel was in order. \n\nSimilar to sirens he responded to, Samuel generated a certain kind of alarm in Winston's mind too. It was time to figure out who was saving lives and who was ending them. Perhaps, sometimes, they were one and the same, Winston couldn't help but consider as he headed to interview the paramedic, and potential suspect, Samuel.\n\nWinston was a weathered detective who had seen it all, or so he thought, until he was handed his latest case - the murder of Isolde. The crime scene was none other than her shared home office with her partner, Bernard. The fatal weapon, strangely ominous, was a strand of barbed wire.\n\nAfter hearing the details and evidence, Winston found himself interviewing Bernard, the primary suspect and Isolde's live-in partner. Bernard resided a far distance from the oftentimes chaotic city that Winston had become accustomed to. He owned a sizable cattle ranch, his pride and joy, and importantly, his primary source of income. \n\nUpon entering the shared living space of Bernard and Isolde, Winston could not help but notice the peculiar co-existence of their realities. The cattle rancher, strong and rugged, cohabiting with Isolde, a woman known for her tight grip over critical territories in the criminal underworld. These territories not only had huge implications for their income but also facilitated their criminal endeavors. \n\n\"Bernard,\" Winston began in his calm, measured tone, \"Can you account for your whereabouts on the night of Isolde's murder?\" \n\n\"I was here. Alone,\" Bernard slowly responded, his words echoing the stark emptiness of their shared home. His only alibi appeared to be his isolated ranch.\n\nWinston was aware of one crucial information piece; Bernard's regular grumbles about Isolde's monopoly over the crime territories. A monopoly Bernard would have liked to gain control of, no less. \"There seemed to be persistent disagreement between you and Isolde over these territories, is that right Bernard?\" \n\nBernard chuckled deeply, \"It's simple, detective. In our line of work, we all want more territory, it directly influences our business.\"\n\nGlancing across the ranch, Winston's gaze fell on the fences that lacked their usual barbed wire adornment. \"Seems like you're short on barbed wire,\" he said.\n\n\"Needed it for a fence repair. Got distracted before I could finish,\" Bernard replied nonchalantly. \n\n\"But isn't it odd that nobody else in town reported any missing barbed wire?\" \n\nBernard gave no response, his eyes offering a contrasting silence to the glaring sun. As Winston prepared to leave, he couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to this story. Bernard was alone at the moment of Isolde's reported murder, with no visitors reported during the time of the crime, and his own sprawling ranch as the only possible alibi. His suspicions deepened by the fact that Bernard had had a clear motive - the lure of control over vast crime territories.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Samuel\nB.

Addison, the mechanic apprentice, was working under the car hood. He flipped through a book that was on a nearby table while working. Every time he paused to point out something in the room, like the faded motivational posters on the wall or the cozy layout of the waiting area, Winston chuckled. Addison always had an eye for room decor.\n\n\"Hard at work I see.\" Winston said, breaking the silence. \n\nAddison shut the book and turned to face him. \"The work never ends,\" he replied, looking Winston up and down. \n\n\"I hear you were at the same camping site as Ernest. He was found murdered there.\" Winston shared. \n\n\"Work, school, camping... always busy.\" Addison replied, his gaze wandering again. He'd developed a habit - one even his fellow students noticed during lunch breaks and in every class - of constantly looking around at different parts of the room. \n\nWinston noticed that tendency walked hand in hand with his need to stay busy, like a curious mind reaching for unknown boundaries. 'Just like him to always have his nose in a book even during lunch breaks', he thought.\n\n\"But it's not always just work and school, right?\" Winston asked. \"You also attend those parties out in the campground, yeah?\" There had been a big one on the night of the murder.\n\nAddison picked the book off the table and flipped through the pages, shrugging nonchalantly. \"Yeah, I was there. So was half the town. Doesn't mean I know anything about what happened to Ernest. That party was big, a lot could've happened.\"\n\nNext to Addison, Winston noticed an array of tools lined up on the workbench. Screwdrivers, hammers, and a crowbar among others, which was casually left on the side of the workbench. He'd seen Addison regularly with his work tools, it was part of being an apprentice.\n\n\"So, you're a mechanic apprentice, right?\" Winston asked. \"You work with these kinds of tools every day?\"\n\nAddison looked at him for a moment before nodding. \"That's right. It's my field of work. Handling tools like crowbars is just part of the job.\"\n\nWinston left Addison with his book and his workshop, making his way out to his car.\n\nCamping, tool handling, busy campgrounds... Winston had a lot to think about on the drive back to the station. But, as always, the detective knew better than to rush to any conclusions just yet. The only thing certain was that everyone he met added a new piece to the puzzle. That was the nature of his job, chasing the truth and sifting through the fragments of life his line of work offered him. Little by little, every witness, every suspect, and every victim told their own part of the story.\n\nWinston watched Octavia’s firm grip around her mug of lukewarm coffee. She was a sturdy woman, her experience in construction before joining the police force wasn't common knowledge, but it gave her that burly silhouette. He also knew that she had picked up a knack for handling construction tools, crowbars included, from her watch in the building business.\n\n\"Officer Octavia,\" started Winston, trying to appear casual, \"Officer 'tavia,\" he corrected himself, as per the way locals referred to her, \"you were on patrol the night Ernest was murdered, correct?\"\n\nHer gaze remained steady, not threatening nor hesitant, \"Yes, that would be right.\"\n\n\"Were the campgrounds along your route?\" asked Winston, knowing that he was treading on thin ice. The campgrounds which were part of her regular beat were also where poor Ernest was found dead.\n\n\"They sure were,\" she replied without diverting her gaze. \"I've patrolled there for years now.\"\n\nWinston pressed on, “Ernest, a known revealer of secrets, was threatening to leak his current findings. He'd uncovered an officer’s shady past and he claimed it was yours. Know anything about that?”\n\nOctavia just looked through him, her facial muscles taut as she remained stoic. \"Ernest was always digging around for information, but I can't say I do.\"\n\nStaying strategic, he continued, \"Ernest indicated that this officer with supposed shady practices was involved in illegal activities before joining the force. Oddly reminiscent of your own construction and police career, Octavia. Fearful of any skeletons in the closet that might be found?”\n\nHere, Octavia's mask seemed to crack, but just for a moment, \"I've no idea what you're implying.\"\n\nWinston chose his next words carefully, conscious of her legal knowledge, “Do you have access to a crowbar, officer Octavia?”\n\nShe let out a short laugh, a sarcastic retort forming on her lips, “Well, every police department has its set of tools, Winston. Are you implying because we have crowbars, we might be swinging them at the locals?”\n\nWinston remained silent, letting Octavia’s scoff hang in the air before speaking again. He gently changed the direction of his questions, “During your patrol last night, did you happen to see anything out of ordinary at the camp?”\n\n“Just a quiet starry night, nothing too wild happening in my town, Winston.”\n\nAs the conversation winded up, Winston decided to leave Octavia with one last piece of thought, “Ernest had hinted at uncovering a cop's illegal past, may be yours. It does seem like there’s something you’d want to keep from the force.”\n\nFor the first time during their conversation, Octavia looked unsure. She shook her head, \"I couldn't tell you, Winston.\"\n\nAs an investigative officer himself, Winston knew the camaraderie among the police ranks. Tonight he’d heard enough. He’d got Octavia talking, about her quiet patrol night and the secret that she urgently seemed to want buried, and her past involvement in illegal activities. As he left Octavia’s living room, he could not help but wonder more about this lady cop with a knack for using crowbars.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Addison\nB.

The murder had taken place in a wrestling ring, and Winston had a connection with the victim, Cecil.\n\nWinston decided to pay a visit to Theresa, a flower girl, and a recent ex-girlfriend of Cecil. She lived alone, in a house far from the usual hustle and bustle of the city. Winston noticed the extraordinary silence that surrounded her home; no visitors and probably no witnesses.\n\nAs he waited for her to answer the door, he noticed a course completion certificate for gun safety framed on her wall. It was dated last year.\n\n\"Interesting,\" he muttered to himself, knocking once more. \n\nHer mother, a police officer herself, opened the door. Winston quickly introduced himself and asked for Theresa. It was while they waited together for Theresa, the mother casually mentioned how she pushed Theresa to take a gun safety course when she borrowed her off-duty pistol for protection purposes.\n\nTheresa was a regular at the local park, where Winston managed to find her later that day. He was surprised to see her all alone in the green expanse, devoid of any human interaction. \n\n\"Evening Theresa,\" Winston started. \n\nShe glanced towards him, and Winston could see the emotional upheaval in her eyes. \"Bad day?\"\n\n\"A lot of those, recently,\" she confessed and Winston noted how Cecil's recent break-up with her had her on an edge. He delved into the night of the murder, asking her where she was that evening.\n\n\"Well, I uh... I found myself at the wrestling ring that night. I wasn't in a good place and I... I just needed to see Cecil one last time...\"\n\nAs she spoke, Winston could sense the heavy emotional burden she was carrying. The mat, the spotlight, and Cecil wrestling that night – it all reminded her of times that once were but would never be again.\n\nAs the cold moonlight filtered through the grimy windows onto the still darkened bar, Winston swung open the door. The dim street outside was almost as quiet as the bar. The wrestling ring in the corner of the bar silently reminded Winston of Cecil's tragic end that happened shortly after the last gig.\n\nThe bar chairs were turned upside down on the tables, a common practice to signal the closing time for an establishment. As the place was empty, it was clear that Tiffany, the bartender, would have cleaned up after the wrestling match and night's business. Winston remembered hearing from the other staffers how Tiffany was always the last to leave, her commitment ensuring that she was there till the bar was ready for the next day.\n\nWinston couldn't help but remember that, according to the witnesses, Tiffany was still at work even after the wrestling match was over and the bar should've been closed. Winston nodded to himself; this was a violation of the law.\n\nAlso, there was talk about Tiffany serving alcohol beyond the mandated hours, to which Cecil himself was privy to. The violation would have been enough to cost Tiffany both her bartender’s license and her job if it reached the right ears. Cecil had planned to expose this, which Winston found interesting. Could this have been the catalyst for the brewing storm?\n\nHowever, Winston was left without much to say when he found a silver pistol tucked away in one of the storage rooms of the bar. A chill ran down his spine as he recognized that it was the weapon that ended Cecil's life.\n\n\"Been doing a bit of spring cleaning?\" Winston asked, showing the service permit Tiffany had applied for her concealed carry. A fact usually ignored by regular folks but not by a detective like Winston, \"It’s quite a setup you have behind the counter. How often do you get such rowdy patrons that you need to pack heat?\"\n\nTiffany responded, \"Only to ensure safety.\"\n\nNodding at her reply, Winston continued looking around the bar. He'd been in bars where wrestling matches were held before, but there was a unique allure to this joint. It embraced the rough and tumble nature of such events, welcoming the wrestling matches as part of the nightlife.\n\n\"Tiffany, you have an interesting gig,” Winston remarked, “Hosting wrestling matches at the bar, well, given the scene, it does seem fitting.”\n\nTiffany chuckled slightly at this statement, “I do what I can to keep the doors open detective.”\n\nWith that reply, Winston ended his investigations and stepped out into the brisk night, his mind filtering and analyzing the layers of facts and statements. He glanced back at the bar, his gaze falling on Tiffany still behind the counter, alone with the closing rituals.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Tiffany\nB.

You’ve got quite a bit of unrestricted access, huh?\".\n\n\"Well, one of the perks of the job.\" Unity shrugged, her gaze resting confidently on the detective.\n\n\"Speaking of jobs, detective,\" she said, gesturing towards a leaflet on the table that detailed the different types of tridents. \"Having spent years getting certified to handle these ancient artifacts, I now explain about these tridents as part of my daily routine. Not everyone can do that.\"\n\nThe detective couldn't help but notice Unity's slight smirk. \"I can imagine,\" Winston replied casually. \"This kind of specialized training demands skill, doesn’t it?\"\n\nUnity chuckled at that. \"Indeed, it does...\"\n\n“The roller rink, it’s not too far from here, is it?” Detective Winston asked, pointing down the street.\n\n\"No, just a short walk. It's practically on the same street as us,\" Unity confirmed, her tone cautious now. \"I was there earlier today, right after completing my last tour and just before the dreadful incident happened. I didn't notice anything unusual.\"\n\nDetective Winston gave her a non-committal nod, his attention now elsewhere as he studied a photo held at an angle, the light catching a face he knew too well. \"Ah, Clarence?” Unity's frozen nod and dead stare confirmed his suspicion. The victim had been convinced Unity was a fraud, publicly threatening to expose the loopholes in her supposedly comprehensive knowledge on maritime history just before his untimely murder.\n\nUnity was proud, her reputation meant everything to her.\n\nWinston's eyes returned to Unity, her face pale under the museum's poor lighting. He had nothing concrete that could tie Unity to the murder, but the pieces were falling into place.\n\n“Well, Unity, thank you for your time,” Winston concluded as he left the museum, leaving Unity alone among the ancient displays and echoing silence.\n\nWinston was sitting down in a neon-lit roller rink, his tired eyes soaking in the scene of Clarence's unusual murder. No leads except for one: Vivian, a vendor who worked in the rink. He'd heard rumors about her past, her fascination with historical warfare, and her penchant for sprinkling violent movie quotes during conversations. \n\nHe had heard from the other vendors in the roller rink, how they found her behavior disconcerting, especially during meetings when she'd regale them with dialogues from brutal, blood-soaked films. Not just that, she was known to have an unnerving love for these violent movies, a fact confirmed by countless customers who recounted their conversations with her. \n\nWinston knew Vivian had a sister. A sister who once confided in her about Clarence's inappropriate messages. Vivian, with her history of being fiercely protective of her sister – once even taking on a bully who bothered the little girl - perceived Clarence's behavior as a threat.\n\nWith all this knowledge, Winston decided he should go and meet up with Vivian. It wasn't a short ride; he had to traverse the half-lit, mostly deserted city. But, it was necessary.\n\nAs he knocked on Vivian's front door, anxiety crept over him. He didn't know what to expect.\n\n\"Hello, Detective,\" Vivian greeted him after opening the door. Her house was filled with vintage items, among which was a trident, an artifact Winston couldn't help but notice. \"Yes, I'm a bit of a relic collector myself,\" Vivian confessed.\n\nThey talked about her job at the rink, her colleagues, and much to Winston's astonishment, she even mentioned attending a trident handling course last summer. Vivian's passionate recall of her past as a historian specializing in ancient warfare left a lasting impression. \n\nThe conversation shifted to more personal matters. As Winston learned more about her family, Vivian confirmed that her sister was indeed her last living relative. She recounted about how she defended her sister against bullies in the past and how she was in an uncomfortable position due to Clarence's intrusive behavior.\n\nWinston asked, \"Clarence used to come around a lot, didn't he?\" Vivian's face turned stiff, \"Yes, he did. Always with the same routine. Always bothering my sister non-stop.\"\n\n\"Well, someone poisoned the well, didn't they?\" Vivian quoted, sounding like a character from one of her favorite films. Winston left her in silence, leaving her own words as a cryptic closure. \n\nAs he exited, Winston felt a shiver run down his spine. Exiting the lonesome house and her world of historical artifacts and violent movie quotes, he couldn't shake off the eeriness of Vivian’s world. \n\nFinally, Winston drove off, leaving Vivian's historical artifact-filled refuge behind, the chilling quotes from violent movies reverberating in his ears.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

It was his day off, a rare occasion in the life of a hardened detective, but duty didn't respect quiet mornings or coffee. The unfortunate murder of Isla had occurred on his watch and it was up to him to untangle the clues left behind.\n\nHe found himself standing in a vast rainforest. The very place where Isla met her untimely demise. His experienced eyes scanned the area before landing on a familiar figure. It was Brian, the janitor, seen at all hours, obsessively stalking Isla. It was just his luck that he was wiping away the forest's mess on the same day Isla was murdered.\n\n\"Brian,\" Winston nodded in his approach.\n\n\"Detective,\" Brian glanced over, he had the sort of look about him that suggested countless solitary hours, only interrupted by the hustle of cleaning. \n\n\"I've been hearing you're no stranger to dealing with broken things.\" Winston observed Brian's hands that were well-versed in handling tools: hammers, wrenches, even lead pipes. His workspace, a vast and meticulous orchestration of order amidst chaos, was proof of that.\n\n\"Mmm, yeah.\" Brian's face softened. A chase of a memory flickered over his face of all the times he had publicly declared his deep love for Isla. \"Isla was one of those broken things. I thought I could fix her. My love her was no secret. I couldn’t live without her,” he confessed his frequent late night contemplations. \n\nDespite the heaviness of the conversation, Winston resumed his careful perusal of Brian’s workspace. His attention was drawn to eerily similar lead pipes, ones that resembled the murder weapon the most. They were common in Brian's line of work, not only for the miscellaneous repairs but also to manage some uncontrollable burst pipes.\n\n\"Managed to fix a burst pipe, haven't you Brian?\" Winston queried, but pondered, could that skill have escalated to the darker realms?\n\n\"Many of them, to be exact. That one over yonder nearly ruined my workspace.\" Brian chuckled, pointing at a spot behind Winston.\n\n\"And yet you're here, hours after word gets out about Isla…”\n\n“It’s been a decade, detective. A decade plus of working in this rainforest and Isla was…” Brian's voice hitched a moment, \"...she was everything. I couldn't live without her.\"\n\nJust then, a soft rustling filled the silence. To Winston's surprise, the lights of Brian's obsession with Isla emerged. He intuitively directed Winston five steps to the left. A moment later, a large tree branch came crashing down exactly where Winston had stood, a product of the lush, unpredictable rainforest Brian had been maintaining for over a decade.\n\n\"Thanks. I suppose you know this place, like back of your hand, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Comes with the territory.\"\n\nWinston repeated his mantra mentally. Every suspect is just a character until proven guilty. As he wound his way back, the very last thing his purposeful steps echoed in Brian's lonely world was when Isla’s public rejection had embarrassingly stung Brian.\n\nBut facts were facts. A man, admittedly obsessed with a woman, now found murdered in a place he had called home for a decade, at a time he definitely was present. A man who liked to fix things, had access to tools, especially lead pipes. All facts, all cataloged. But Winston was far from writing the end to this chapter. As the detective stalked off, his mind was already moving, spinning, weaving another part of this tragic story.\n\nWinston was alert to the rustling sounds of the rainforest, conscious that this deceptively peaceful location hid a sinister secret. A murder had taken place here and Isla, a devoted member of a local club for enthusiasts of unsolved crimes, was the victim. Her lifeless body, found under a fallen tree, and a near-by lead pipe marked the tragic remnants of an unsolved crime. Winston was compelled to uncover the truth, especially as he was cognizant of a deep, dark secret that Isla had discovered: Jesse, the president of their club, was involved in illegal activities.\n\nJesse's name was constantly mentioned during the initial investigations. He was no ordinary member of the club, he was the president and also a famed drummer. His rhythmic skills had not only provided him with a lifestyle most would envy but also a sizable disposable income, leading to his immense respect and love from his community. Jesse was known for having a lot of free time, especially on the weekends. Jesse became Winston's next stop in the investigation.\n\nIgnoring the pulsating heat of the afternoon, Winston headed to Jesse's house. Guided by the rhythmic sounds of a drum that echoed in the stillness, he made his way. As he neared, the drumming ceased and Jesse's piercing gaze met him.\n\n\"Detective Winston,\" Jesse rose to his feet, \"I've been expecting you.\"\n\n\"Expecting me?\" Winston asked, a raised eyebrow almost disappearing under his cap.\n\n\"Yes, I heard about poor Isla,\" Jesse replied, a flicker of sadness crossed his face.\n\nJesse was a frequent visitor of the rainforest during his free weekends, a place he went seeking inspiration for his musical compositions. \"Rainforest vibes, man, they produce the best drum solos,\" he said, crediting his most impressive works as a drummer to the time he spent in the rainforest, jotting down notes in his notepad.\n\nSuddenly, his phone rang and he seemingly needed privacy for the call, returning after a few minutes looking flustered. Winston noted this change but didn't comment.\n\nJesse began to discuss the club. He described it as a casual group that met every fortnight to discuss famous unsolved crime mysteries, watch documentaries, and talk about criminal profiling. \"The irony,\" he laughed dryly, \"now we have our own club mystery.\"\n\nTalking about Isla seemed to disturb him. He confessed, \"I overheard Isla a few days ago... she found out about my… my involvement in illegal activities. She was planning to go to the police…” Jesse was visibly worried, afraid that this could potentially shatter his career, and with it, his sizable disposable income and tarnish his reputation.\n\nSilently pondering the possibility of Jesse having been pushed to silence Isla, Winston finished his coffee, neatly recording the conversation in his mind’s eye for later.\n\nPulling on his coat, Winston was enveloped again by the rainforest’s familiar sounds. His clear blue eyes squinting determinedly into the shifting shadows. He knew that the next chapter of this twisted tale was yet to be penned, but he was one step closer now, the connection between Isla's exposure of Jesse’s illicit activities and her untimely death seemed more likely.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

While trying to gather his thoughts together, he rubbed his temples to get rid of the throbbing headache. The location was the local town's hockey rink. An odd location for sure, but it was where Justin had intended to give a speech criticizing Yvette during the show's intermission. \n\nJustin's attacker had used a rope to commit the brutal crime. 'A bit theatrical, perhaps?' Winston thought and headed toward Yvette's house for a routine chat. Upon reaching, he knocked the door and greeted Yvette with a smile.\n\n\"Hi, Yvette?\" Detective Winston began, pulling out his own chair at her inviting patio. \"I have a few questions to ask pertaining to the events of the last night.\"\n\nHis gaze drifted around her property. Ropes were strewn and coiled up in various places. As a choreographer, she often used ropes as props in her performances. It wasn't uncommon because they learned various forms of knot-tying for staging and safety purposes. Even a noose. \n\n\"It was Justin's idea that I choreograph a sequence around hockey. Odd choice, but I ran with it.\" Yvette started talking while sipping her coffee.\n\n\"And were you at the rink when this all transpired?\" He asked steering back to the line of questioning.\n\n\"Most of the day, yes.\" Yvette confirmed. \"I was there for the initial setup and Justin was there too.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston quietly exclaimed to himself.\n\nHe knew Yvette’s reputation as a choreographer was critical to her. It was not just her source of income; it was her status, her life. The allegation that she had been plagiarizing her choreographies... it was a heavy burden. Justin’s impending confession would have been devastating. Yvette had seen an early draft of the revealing speech herself.\n\n\"Did the speech upset you, Yvette?\" He asked, wrapping up his interrogation. \n\n\"What can I say detective, people have opinions,\" Yvette defended, \"I just try to focus on my work.\"\n\nEngagements done for the day, detective Winston made his way back to the precinct. Another puzzle to solve, another murderer to catch; the game was beginning. He had a feeling it was going to be a long night.\n\nStacks of paperwork about the latest crime related to a high-profile hockey player, Justin, lay across Winston’s desk. Retirement had been just around the corner for Justin but his life was cut short and the hockey rink, ironically, had witnessed his curtain fall. His team had been under a dark cloud of continuous defeat recently. \n\nThe local therapy center caught Winston's eye. They had a peculiar technique using ropes. He directed his steps towards the center, questions ricocheting throughout his mind.\n\nAs he arrived, he noticed a woman, seemingly absorbed in her own world. His scan quickly landed on the oddity clenched earnestly in her hands—a small locket. He introduced himself to her, \"Hello...Lillian, right?\"\n\nLillian looked up from her reverie, \"Yes, that's correct,\" she responded, her gaze drifting back to the locket.\n\nWinston’s eyes darted to the locket, noted, and quickly moved away. He dug out the files about Lillian's background. Lillian had frequently disclosed amongst her circle of friends that she passionately coveted the captain's position.\n\n\"Does the therapy center monitor use of rope?\" Winston enquired casually.\n\n\"No sir, we don't have any set rules about rope usage here,\" Nurse Emma replied, \"Otherwise we'd not be able to perform a lot of exercises.\"\n\nNurse Emma appeared aloof, \"Trust me, I've tried to make a conversation with her. She mostly stays quiet, lost in her locket.\"\n\nWinston turned back to Lillian. Mutual animosity could have easily settled between Lillian and the victim in such a competitive environment, given their circumstances.\n\nWinston looked at Lillian, her head bowed low, avoiding any eye contact just like she did in her group sessions, according to the other patients.\n\nWinston weighed his next words carefully, \"Lillian... heard you've been wanting to be the team captain.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did want that...\" her voice trailed away, \"I believe I would have done a good job.\" Her tone dripped with contempt and displeasure towards Justin's power.\n\nThe detective felt like he had made some strides. Throughout his years, he had learned to carefully gather pieces to a seemingly unsolvable puzzle. The events of the day already earned a special notation in his mental files. Silently, Detective Winston drove back towards the precinct, a storm of thoughts racing as swiftly as his accelerating car. He knew this was just the beginning of a path penned with enigmas.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Yvette\nB.

Jamal's empty chair, a token of a dangerous gamble. Too high of a stake, with a godchild as your appointed dealer.\n\n\"Lillian, was it?\" Winston began, attempting to keep his tone as neutral as possible. The woman before him, a young biologist specializing in amphibians, nodded as she squirmed slightly under his gaze.\n\n\"Jamal spoke highly of you,\" he said, casting an eye towards her drink. She gulped, but stayed silent.\n\n\"He trusted you,\" Winston continued, surveying the crime scene with his trained eye. \"Even was seen taking a sip from your very drink there.\"\n\nLillian straightened in her chair. \"Always giving him advice,\" Winston mused, a thought dancing at the edge of his vision. \"And always willing to try something new.\"\n\nIt wasn't hard to guess that Lillian had always desired more. The lust for power hung around her like an exotic perfume, intoxicating to those in her proximity. She wanted to be Jamal. Jamal, the casino mogul; his elusive empire tantalizingly within reach.\n\nOutside, the neon lights of the casino blinked erratically, casting an eerie greenish hue over the scene. A darting shadow caught Winston's attention - a strange silhouette of a rare species of frog in a glass tank, well-known amongst biologists for its lethal toxins, shimmered in the glow. An interesting pet for a woman so consumed with desire.\n\n\"Lillian, you're a herpetologist, we gather?\" Winston questioned, inclining his head towards the amphibian. She nodded, a glint appearing in her eyes. \"And you've been studying the toxins of this frog for years...\"\n\nDismissing Lillian, Winston surveyed the casino once more. It was a den of decadence, a palace of transient prosperity run by Jamal, the giver of fortunes, who had no other known kin but a science-smitten child drawn to the perilous allure of her amphibian pets.\n\nOne clear fact remained. Jamal had listened to Lillian and she... well, she was next in line for his throne. This was not a conjecture but a simple fact an observer might note, just as one might notice the inescapable presence of a rare poison frog in Lillian's possession.\n\nAs Winston made his exit from the pulsating hub of the casino, his mind turned over the night's events. Lillian, pacing the casino floor, her eyes on Jamal, and Jamal's undying trust in his favored godchild. Pieces of a puzzle waiting to be fit together. But that, he left strictly for the reader to sort out.\n\nAs Winston strolled through the garish neon lights of the casino, he watched the footage replay on the manager's phone. There they were, tucked into the high stake section; Kimberly, a picture-perfect shuffle of a grandma, and Jamal, joyfully throwing himself into the game with wild abandon.\n\n\"Yes,\" the manager confirmed for him. \"That’s Kimberly. Her card records place her at the same table as Jamal that night. She didn't leave until the medics arrived for him.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston replied, still not looking up from the phone.\n\nThe detective continued his rounds, shuffling further into the labyrinth of the casino. Finally, he found the bar. He nodded at the barman, an inquisitive look in his eyes. \"Kimberly brought Jamal a drink that night, didn’t she?\"\n\nThe barman swiped at an imaginary spill as he raised an eyebrow at Winston. \"Yeah, she did. One of those fancy drinks.\" His fingers drummed thoughtfully on the bartop, \"She had it delivered to the table he was playing at. He drank it right away too.\"\n\nAnother loose thread to tuck away, perhaps. Winston next stop was Kimberly's house. Neighbors echoed praises about the grandmother, painting her as a caring woman who enjoys watching her grandchildren. Interestingly enough, each grandchild seemed to know her by a different name, and according to the school records, each had a distinct backstory of ‘grandma Kimberly’.\n\nWinston cradled a cup of coffee as he glanced through Kimberly's research papers. Geological, biological, a vast array of topics. But one caught his eye; a detailed study on various poisons, including how much was lethal. Of particular interest was one paper detailing the extraction methods for poison from a highly dangerous frog species.\n\nFlipping through her mail, each letter addressed to a unique mailing address, one for each city Kimberly had grandchildren. Winston noticed the faint hum of an odd contraption in her basement. Upon closer inspection, it was an ornate humidifier. Sitting inside a glass tank, a small frog, the same species she had written about.\n\n\"Got yourself a pet frog, Kimberly?\" Winston asked, blinking back a sense of unease.  \n\n\"Well, yes, I thought it'd be fascinating to own one,\" Kimberly answered, her voice steady yet pleasant. \"After buying it, I've done a lot of reading on it too.\"\n\n“I can tell,” Winston said, lightly tapping at the glass, his gaze looking upon the venomous creature inside, through the misty veil, before flicking over at Kimberly for a brief moment, \"I can tell.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The potent scent of bleach hung heavily in the air, a sensation that left a harsh taste in Winston's mouth. The smell was familiar - an offensive olfactory signature that he associated with one man, Clyde, a plumber known by his colleagues for frequently incorporating bleach into his work as part of his cleaning regimen.\n\nHis next stop was Clyde's regular haunt, the local union of plumbers. As Winston walked in, he spotted Clyde, his sketchbook in hand, a common sight in his daily life where he was seen everywhere with it - even the park, where pedestrians would note his unmistakable silhouette sketching in the fading sunset.\n\n\"Morning, Clyde,\" Winston greeted. The burly plumber acknowledged him while carefully retrieving something from his bag. \n\n\"Yeah?\" Clyde retorted, his ever-present sketchbook peeking from the crevice of his well-worn bag.\n\n\"I see you've got that sketchbook of yours.\" Winston gestured, the sketchbook already a topic of many conversations among Clyde's colleagues.\n\n\"Yes,\" Clyde held it up. \"I just came from the park. Sketched some people. Most were oblivious.\"\n\n\"Something to keep your mind at ease, right?\" Winston deduced, knowing Clyde's odd habits from previous conversations.\n\n“Exactly! I've been a fan of sketching ever since my first ex-girlfriend. Helped me cope with my... possessiveness,\" Clyde admitted, his underlying nature painting a clearer picture to Winston.\n\nWinston subtly noticed Clyde’s clothing reeking of bleach, a plumbing prerequisite that often resulted in him leaving work, smelling like he'd just scrubbed down a newly cleaned bathroom.\n\n“Would you know anything about Jim?” Winston directed the conversation, veering away from Clyde's routine.\n\nClyde's mood shifted subtly, “Yeah, my recent ex. She’s now with him... Jim.\" Clyde confessed, his voice bitter as he recalled the numerous occasions he'd been witness to Jim's overly familiar and openly flirtatious demeanor with his ex, a sight he forcefully ignored, especially when he was sketching in the park.\n\n\"Your ex? The very one who confirmed she was dating Jim?\" Winston asked, dubiously.\n\n“Yeah, she left me for him… Jim, who enjoyed making a spectacle of himself, openly flirting with her in public. Hard to miss when you're watching.” Clyde admitted, referring to when he was seen spying on Jim and his ex-girlfriend recently.\n\n\"Well, better safe than sorry,” Winston responded, cleverly implying his knowledge of Clyde's recent surveillance antics.\n\n“Exactly,\" Clyde quietly concurred, before falling silent.\n\n“Alright, Clyde. Thanks for your time.” Winston stood to leave, a wave of vigilante justice washing over him as he exited the plumbers union, leaving Clyde to his sketching, an activity his union peers had noticed often happened on his days off.\n\nDeep in his office at the local precinct, Detective Winston sifted through the crime scene photos again. Jim, a well-known wrestling hero, was now just another file sitting on his desk. The cause of death - bleach poisoning.\n\nSwitching on his computer, Winston pulled up the latest piece of evidence - a CCTV footage from a nearby pharmacy. There, he saw Roxanne, a persistent critic of Jim's wrestling tactics, making a purchase. The timestamp on the video showed the same day of Jim's tragic demise.\n\nWinston got up, deciding to pay Roxanne a visit. On getting to her place, he saw her retrieving a ticket to a wrestling match from one of her drawers. The date matched the one on the pharmacy’s CCTV.\n\n\"Hi, Roxanne. Nice place you've got here,\" Winston began.\n\n\"Thank you. Detective right? How can I help you?\" Roxanne replied.\n\n\"Just a few questions. You went to Jim's match, correct?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I retrieved this ticket from my drawer this morning. Wanted to see if his moves had improved.\"\n\nWinston was quite intrigued, \"As a nurse, what brings you to wrestling matches? Not your usual night out, I assume?\"\n\n\"No detective. It’s purely professional. Being a fan of the sport, I had some... let's say disagreements with Jim's wrestling. In fact, I have quite frequently denounced his techniques during our gym sessions.\"\n\nWinston nodded. Back at the station, he found a lot of hate speech addressed at Jim online, written under Roxanne's username. He also found her search history that showed she had been researching about bleach poisoning. This woman had been openly critical of Jim. Some members of the wrestling community even regarded her criticism as a hate crime against wrestlers.\n\n\"Was the wrestling match good?\" Winston asked out of the blue.\n\n\"It was the usual stuff. Jim's techniques bore me. I even told him so a couple of times at the gym, but he never would listen.\"\n\nIntrigued by her choice of words, Winston subtly added, \"Yeah, his techniques seem to draw in the crowds, nonetheless. He was getting quite famous attending all these major matches.\"\n\n\"No doubt about that,\" she replied.\n\n\"And you made a 'stop' before heading to the wrestling match?\" Winston asked casually.\n\n\"Stop? Oh, you mean the pharmacy. Had to get some household supplies, including a bottle of bleach,\" she explained.\n\nWinston watched her as she spoke. He'd done a quick check before he came. There were no reported thefts of bleach in the surrounding area and this made sense. Roxanne, with her nursing background, didn't need to steal it. She had all the knowledge she needed, right at her fingertips, including how to use bleach as a…poison?\n\nExiting her home, Winston decided to return to the precinct. He had a lot of evidence to sift through, including the evidences that showed Roxanne had been openly critical of Jim at their gym and her online research history about bleach poisoning.

He had known her for a while in the professional world - She was a respected, even renowned, contractor. Every evening, after an exhausting day at work, it was a common sight to see Aubrey trudging home, her hands loaded with tools from a difficult day of managing construction projects. Among all the tools, the heavy-duty nail guns were a constant companion. Aubrey was always working on projects that involved a lot of nailing, such as erecting wooden framings or installing roofing and siding. \n\n\"Detective Winston,\" Aubrey greeted him from the porch, clasping her hands stained with a year's worth of construction grime, \"What brings you to my neck of the woods?\" \n\nWinston cleared his throat as he glanced at the construction tools visibly scattered around her house. Nail guns, power saws - everything you would find in a contractor's toolkit. As a person who often worked on structures from scratch, nail guns were typically a requirement due to their versatility. \n\n\"Got a moment?\" Winston asked, trying to keep the gravity out of his voice. Aubrey agreed and led him to her home office, which interestingly, was doubling as a toolshed. He once again couldn't help but notice a few nail guns among the equipment at her home. A professional necessity or a personal preference, he wondered. \n\n\"It's about Lauren,\" Winston began. Aubrey's face stiffened. \"We found confidential documents at her house. Seems she was planning something... something that involved your company.\"\n\nAubrey looked surprised momentarily, but then her face settled into a serious expression. She admitted to overhearing a conversation between Lauren and McDowell, her rival, confirming Winston's suspicions. \n\nAubrey's company was known for creating unique structures, like the complex labyrinth where Lauren was found dead. Aubrey had designed and supervised its construction. And since it was situated within her business property, Aubrey always maintained full access to it. However, much to Winston's surprise, the labyrinth had no public blueprints or maps, as Aubrey preferred to keep it unique. \n\nAs Winston left Aubrey's home, he knew he still had a lot of facts to untangle, not least of which was Lauren's apparent attempt to betray Aubrey's trust by selling confidential business secrets to a competitor. But with Aubrey's insights, he was ready to dig deeper into the nuanced maze of Lauren's mysterious death.\n\nWinston sat in silence at the edge of the chaotic crime scene, the labyrinth had become a monstrous cavity of mystery, with its winding tunnels and disorienting dead ends. What had happened to Lauren was no less perplexing, and one name kept echoing through the investigators' speculation: Rose.\n\nRose, known for her impeccable memory and experience in acting, was a prominent figure in this tightly wound community. She was always present at functions and events, as noted at the most recent meeting, a gathering Winston had attended himself not too long ago.\n\nNot everyone was gentle with their words that day, Winston knew too well. Lauren, the deceased, had thrown around a few insults, Rose being one of her victims. She had been called a loser in front of the whole gathering. Rose came from a gang where respect was paramount, and such humiliation did not sit light on her shoulders, but she had somehow managed to remain unnoticed in the labyrinth later.\n\nSomething caught Winston's interest – Rose's fondness for movies with intense, dramatic scenes. Late at night, from her room's closed door, her family often heard the telltale sound of violent movies emanating. The detective filed that away, nodding as he considered the implications.\n\nRose worked in construction, where reading blueprints was second nature, and interestingly, the blueprint of the labyrinth was accessible at her workplace. Winston noted this with a measure of unsettled interest. After dinner, Rose would often retreat to her room and stay locked in.\n\nAs he reviewed these facts, Winston could already feel the pressure building, and the all-consuming labyrinth of the case looming before him, his mind working tirelessly to map out where his next steps would take him.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The case puzzled him; a man named Clyde was found dead at his chalet, poisoned by snake venom.\n\nWinston sipped his coffee, his thoughts turning to the list of witnesses. The intriguing one was Clyde’s adoptive mother, Taylor. Records indicated she owned a cleaning business, which surprisingly, did not require her or anyone else for that matter, to use different names for business operations. Interesting, Winston thought.\n\nThe cleaning business, however, brought Taylor in frequent contact with venomous snakes due to the locations she was often required to clean. In addition to this, upon further investigation into her past, Winston discovered she had once taken a course on reptile handling and first aid, where she had learned how to administer snake venom. This piqued Winston’s curiosity about Taylor's hobby - her interest in studying and handling snakes. \n\nWinston then took a drive across town to the café where Taylor often frequented. The barista, a young chipper man, recognized Taylor’s name instantly. \n\n“Yeah, big tipper. Always uses a new name when she orders though. Can’t keep up,” he admitted, making an apologetic face.\n\n“Does she always order to-go?” Winston asked. \n\n“Yeah, never stays long.\"\n\nAs he left the café for a public park, Winston could not help but think how it was not just cafes she used different names in. One of the regular park goers also confirmed witnessing Taylor introduce herself with a different name every time she would meet someone new. There was no law requiring her not to, but it was unusual. \n\nTo get a bit more insight, Winston then took a detour and checked her medical records at the local clinic. The records showed frequent admissions for different sort of injuries, seeming to be consistent with those of an abuse victim.\n\nThe final piece in this part of the puzzle was Clyde’s history of domestic violence. Clyde’s neighbours recalled his frequent violent outbursts and admitted that they had worried for Taylor's safety. \n\nOne neighbour, an elderly woman by the name of Gertrude, stated, \"That poor Taylor...she always seemed scared of him. Saying how she was worried about keeping up with his violent tendencies.\"\n\nWith these pieces of information, Detective Winston returned to his office to ponder the implications while the rain pitter-pattered against his window pane.\n\nWinston, with his coffee in one hand and the morning's newspaper in the other, settled into the precinct's bustling atmosphere. Amidst his routine perusal of the adjoining snake-enthusiast article, Mack's name caught his attention. A brief yet impassioned mention of his reptile expertise and his recent acquisition of a venomous snake stood out. His hobby including keeping up to date on the latest snake discoveries was all over the article. An enigma wrapped in exotic scales.\n\nWinston set off to pay Mack a visit at his quite aptly titled store, 'The Design Dwelling.' As he entered, Winston's eyes glimpsed over recent store receipts strewn on the countertop — snake food, terrarium equipment, and the marked receipt for the venomous snake purchase formed a large chunk of the billings. His gaze then shifted to the restless store-owner. \n\n\"Mack?\" Winston extended a handshake in greeting. \n\n\"Yes, that's me,\" Mack offered a firm grip and an uncertain smile.\n\n\"I see you've got a fascination with the scaled creatures,\" Winston gestured towards the receipts. \n\n\"Just a hobby of mine, detective. Studied reptiles quite extensively in college,\" Mack admitted casually.\n\nRetracing his steps back a little, Winston recalled an interesting piece of information. He asked, \"You worked at Clyde's chalet recently, correct?\" \n\n\"Yes, Clyde hired me for an interior redesign. I had just finished my work and left the chalet with the new layout in hand when I heard...\" Mack faltered, recounting the events. \"In fact, I was seen leaving the chalet clutching the plans, on the day Clyde passed, and the news hit me like a ton of bricks.\"\n\n\"Clyde's passing was unfortunate.\" Winston nodded solemnly, choosing his words with caution. \"You were scheduled to work on his chalet the day he...passed.\"\n\nA nod from Mack confirmed Winston's suspicions. He continued, \"You reported an assault to us a while ago. You called us immediately, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did. I didn't waste any time after I saw it,\" Mack replied. \"I found letters at Clyde's place, threats aimed at my sister in his handwriting. I confronted him about it, and, surprisingly, he admitted it. I saw him assault her once, it horrified me.\"\n\nWinston took note of the interior designer's steady gaze. The urgency in his revelation was palpable. He thanked Mack for his cooperation and moved towards the exit, with his mind etched on the detail that Mack had willingly brought a venomous snake recently. The snake-featured article from earlier that day lay folded inside his coat pocket, a puzzle piece found amidst the chaotic symphony of the morning grind.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

It was a particularly hot day, and the endless rows of hardware supplies inside the store did little to relieve the heat.\n\nFrom afar, he spotted Ivy, her expression soft, as she demonstrated how to properly use a screwdriver to a customer. The toolbelt around her hips, full of screwdrivers, signalled her daily routine. She handled the tool with such familiarity that it was almost intimidating. After a little while, the customer thanked Ivy and left, providing an opportunity for Winston to approach her.\n\n\"Miss Ivy, I presume,\" Winston said, donning a slight smile.\n\n\"That's me,\" She replied, her brow furrowing slightly. “Do I know you?”\n\n“No, we've never met. I’m detective Winston.” He turned to see a toolbelt, a mirror image of Ivy's, containing the same make of screwdriver Ivy was demonstrating earlier, hanging near the counter.\n\nTurning his attention back to Ivy, he asked, “Regular at the synagogue, aren’t you? The same one Vanessa used to attend with you every week?\"\n\nA slight wrinkle formed between her brows. \"Yes, every week,\" she confirmed.\n\nHer composure still intact, Winston continued, \"You arrived before everyone else at the synagogue yesterday, correct? On the unfortunate day when Vanessa was murdered there?\"\n\nA shiver of what could have been fear, or maybe sadness, passed over Ivy's face. \"Yes, I was,\" she admitted, her voice shaky.\n\n“You were seen crying uncontrollably during the eulogy, despite not personally knowing Vanessa?”\n\n“The community is close-knit and Vanessa was part of it,” Ivy replied. “Her murder was devastating.”\n\nWinston nodded, “Her coffin was left unattended and open for a while. That's when you were observed rummaging through her belongings just after the murder. What were you looking for, Miss Ivy?”\n\nIvy looked away, unwilling to answer. Winston noticed, and continued questioning. His gaze eventually settled on an open sign that read, ‘Proud to serve this community since 1995’.\n\n“I’ll be needing you for further questioning, Miss Ivy.\"\n\nWith that, Winston left the shop, trying to disregard the fact that he wore the same look of sorrow as likely everyone in the community.\n\nWinston sipped on lukewarm coffee studying the report in his hands. The office bustled around him as officers ran to-and-fro, but he stayed focused. Vanessa, a local woman, had been found dead in the synagogue, a screwdriver found near her body.\n\nHis attention moved to his suspect, Clarence.\n\nThe interview room was stark with chilled silence. The man across from Winston was built like a truck, trucker strong. \n\n\"You're Clarence?\" Winston asked, breaking the silence.\n\n\"N-Yes\", Clarence stuttered, nodding. His blue eyes held a look of a man seeing something he'd rather not.\n\n\"Your profession?\"\n\n\"Truck driver,\" he answered, a bit more composed. He patted a hefty toolbox to his side. \"Part of the trade. Us truckers always carry one.\"\n\n\"Your work takes you near the synagogue, doesn't it?”\n\n\"Yup,\" Clarence admitted, seemingly proud of his trucker life. \"Often make deliveries in the area. Even do some minor repairs on my truck while I'm waiting for the businesses to open.”\n\nTruck drivers usually carry a heavy-duty toolbox for such repairs. As he chuckled at Winston's lifted eyebrow, their conversation was interrupted by one of Winston's fellow officers walking in. Handing over Clarence's profile to Winston, he disappeared back into the station's chaotic rhythm.\n\nWinston read it out in a clipped tone, one that showed no emotion, \"Vanessa, your ex was found dead today at the synagogue.” He watched Clarence's reaction, a thin sheen of sweat forming on his forehead. \"You were aware of her regular attendance at the synagogue?”\n\nClarence remained silent, only gave a solemn nod.\n\nThe detective carried on, \"A restraining order, filed by Vanessa, was found in the report filed against you.\" His eyes never strayed from Clarence's face, noticing every twitch. \"Your visitation rights to the children were in danger because of it. She reported multiple accounts of domestic violence.\"\n\nTo his surprise, Clarence didn't protest or flare up. He seemed... remorseful? \"I..I... never denied them,\" he whispered. \n\nWith a final scribble, Winston closed the file. The lights above buzzed as he walked out, leaving Clarence with his thoughts. The puzzle remained unsolved, for now.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Ivy\nB.

Camille, Floyd's daughter, seemed like the kind of young rich heiress that didn't need much but still desired more. She'd been seen shopping extravagantly and her credit card statements were full of high-ticket items, including a purchase from a local gun shop just a few days before Floyd's demise. \n\nOn reaching the crime scene, he noticed a shotgun lying nearby. Was this the weapon used to kill Floyd? His experiences from the past suggested that you should never jump to conclusions.\n\nIn Winston's notes, it was mentioned that Camille was often spotted at the local shooting range, practicing with a shotgun during the summer. Camille had undertaken shooting classes the previous summer. She even held a valid shotgun permit. \n\nOn his return to the office, Winston stopped by Camille's residence. She had large, empty display cases, which seemed odd for a girl who spends so much. Winston speculated about what she might be collecting.\n\nSeeing his puzzled look, Camille casually mentioned, \"I've always loved animals.\"\n\nDespite her lavish spending habits, she's surprisingly not involved in crafts that require stuffing materials. She confirmed this when Winston inquired about it. Although, she was once spotted at a local craft store checkout line with bags of stuffing materials.\n\nWhen Winston asked her about this, she said, \"Oh, that wasn't for me. I was picking it up for a friend.\"\n\n\"It's a healthy hobby,\" said Camille when asked about her shotgun permit, while showing him the piece of identification. \n\nWinston was also informed of Floyd's plans to change his will by his attorney. Camille found the updated will in Floyd's study. She didn't seem perturbed by the changes. \n\nBefore he could delve deeper, his phone rang. It was his lieutenant notifying him about a mysterious loan taken by Camille. \"Interesting,\" thought Winston, as he adopted his signature poker face.\n\nAs Winston left Camille's property, he had more questions than answers. Camille's story had many sides and each was a step in a journey full of riddles. Winston knew he needed to investigate further. His virus scanner, gut instinct, was telling him this case was stranger than he thought.\n\nWinston perused the local newspaper, his eyes momentarily pausing on an article announcing a lottery winner named Floyd. It was not the lottery part that grabbed his attention but a picture of Floyd on one of his many solo mountain climbs. He was known to love these solitary treks, stating often to those who asked that they offered him a much respected sense of tranquility. This time though, he had plans for another solitary mountain climb, despite a streak of lousy weather. \"Guess he's celebrating,\" Winston mumbled to himself, seeing his long-time acquaintance's choice of celebration wasn't much of a surprise. \n\nHe switched off his desk lamp, grabbed his hat, and left to interview his first pertinent individual: a local potter named Francis. Francis had also seen the news about Floyd's lottery win, although the celebration was bittersweet knowing his own financial strain.\n\nArriving at the location, Winston found Francis gently molding some clay on a wheel. \"Francis?\" he inquired.\n\nFrancis, a tall lanky figure, turned while still working with the pot. \"That's me, detective.\"\n\n\"Busy doing some pottery?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the potter replied in a serious tone. \"It's my bread and butter. Although, it hasn't been doing well lately. With declining sales, I couldn't even return that loan I took from a shark to keep the business afloat.\"\n\nWinston continued probing, \"Heard you were invited by Floyd on his mountain climbing trip.\"\n\nFrancis washed his hands and turned off the wheel, looking somewhat surprised. \"Yes, that's right. But he said he wanted to go alone this time...said he needed the tranquillity. Floyd always prefered to climb alone.\"\n\n\"Interesting...\" Winston responded under his breath. \"So, you didn't go with Floyd?\"\n\n\"Nah, I was going to go on a hunting trip of my own instead,\" Francis replied, reaching for his favorite shotgun leaning against a nearby wall. He almost always used shotguns on these trips. \n\nDetective Winston knew not to flinch at the sight of the weapon. \"Oh, so, you do a lot of hunting, then.\"\n\nFrancis shrugged, laying the shotgun back against the wall. \"Yeah, it's a hobby. And a chance to breathe fresh air; not much of it in here, you see.\"\n\nWinston nodded, taking mental note of the situation. \"Well, then, I suppose I'd best let you get back to it. We'll be in touch, Francis.\"\n\nOn his drive back to the precinct, Winston received a call about Francis taking a hefty loan from a shark to revive his sagging pottery business. Winston sighed, took off his hat, and mussed his hair. He knew Floyd, despite his undeniable love for his solitary mountain climbs, was blissfully unaware of Francis' financial situation. It was all just another lead unraveling in this ever-complicated mountain murder.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Francis\nB.

Emma, a nurse, introduced herself as the sister of the victim, Daniel. To those present-- mainly strangers, she was a new face. Interestingly enough, she made sure to gracefully ask everyone their names. Among the crowd were Daniel's family, whom she met for the first time that day, despite his prolonged treatment at the hospital. This was an unusual circumstance Winston noted down.\n\nHuman tears could be telling. Winston, having seen more than his fair share of grieving families and friends, noticed that Emma's display during Daniel's funeral was peculiar. Hers were the only eyes that were excessively wet, her crying far more pronounced than anyone else present. It intrigued him that despite this overwhelming show of emotion, nobody from the grieving family seemed to recognize her.\n\n\"Emma was in charge of Daniel's care,\" Hannah, an admin worker at the hospital, provided when Winston sought better understanding of Emma's relationship to the victim. As she spoke, Winston noted down in his leather-bound notebook that Emma was responsible for Daniel's daily schedule due to her duties.\n\nHannah then identified Emma from a picture Winston slid across the table. \"That's her. She's the one who organized that zoo trip for Daniel. His upbeat demeanor that day... He was having such a good time away from the hospital.\" Hannah pausing to reflect brought further solemnity to the memory of that day when Daniel's body, and a syringe from their hospital, was found at the zoo.\n\nAs Winston visited Emma's residence, her life as a nurse was exhibited by the random nursing memorabilia discarded around the apartment; badges, maps of the hospital wards, even Daniel's daily schedule calendar. \n\nEmma's career in medicine wasn't surprising, given her fascination with the field. She was a nurse at the hospital where Daniel was a patient, giving her unrestricted access to his room among others. While her chosen path was understandable, it did make this case more convoluted than the usual ones Winston had come across. As things were unfolding, Emma seemed like she could be a guardian angel... or perhaps a devil in disguise. Winston would have to tread on this puzzle with utmost care.\n\nWinston pored over the crime scene photos spread haphazardly across his desk. Daniel's body had been found at the zoo, his bright red hat found lodged in a tree by the monkey enclosure caught his eye. Early afternoon, he thought to himself. That was when Daniel arrived.\n\nDaniel had been at Amelia's bar the night before he was found dead. Within a corner, separated by the clinking of glasses and the cacophony of laughter, Amelia had noticed Daniel with a friend, showcasing some old pictures on his phone, laughing and boasting about their origin. Amongst these, were humiliating photos he had discovered of Amelia from college. The surprise jolt she felt when she saw her own face from the past peering back at her.\n\nThe bartender was a liked figure, as far as Winston had heard from various patrons. She was known for her flawless reputation, partnered with her proficiency in handling syringes - a necessary detail given her innovative drink creations.\n\nHis mind wandered back to what he had learnt from the police report. Apparently, Daniel had been killed by a lethal injection, distributed so expertly that there was only one syringe mark on his body. A murder weapon that, undoubtedly, connected to Amelia. \n\nThen he remembered Daniel's friend mentioning a conversation at the bar... a piecing together of the puzzle. They had been laughing, Daniel proudly showing off old, humiliating college photos he had found of Amelia. Her past wasn't a secret per se... it was just unnecessary information for a bartender to share.\n\nHe found himself walking towards the custom bar Amelia had set up early that morning at the zoo. Wanting to question her about Daniel's boasting the night before, it served as her temporary workstation for special events.\n\n\"Good afternoon, detective,\" Amelia greeted him with a casual familiarity. There was no one else present there. \"Getting ready to wind up for the night,\" she added, pointing casually towards the empty chairs and booths.\n\nWinston nodded in response. \"Set up here often, Amelia?\" he asked, taking a seat.\n\nAmelia wiped a glass clean then nodded. \"When the occasion calls for it, yes.\"\n\n\"And last night, Daniel visited your usual spot, didn't he?\" Winston continued.\n\nAmelia paused before confirming. \"Yes, he was.\"\n\n\"Have any idea why he was at the zoo today?\" Winston asked.\n\nShe shook her head as she busied herself. \"No idea, detective.\"\n\n\"One last question,\" Winston said. \"How well're you acquainted with syringes, Amelia?\"\n\nBriefly taken aback, Amelia responded. \"I use them for some cocktails. Is there something you're implying, detective?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" Winston replied, leaving her to wonder. He stood up, thanked her then left, knowing she would be closing alone, just like every other night at her bar. Alone during closing, just as it had always been. Winston returned to his desk, itching closer to understanding what had happened to Daniel.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Amelia\nB.

He absently flipped through the case file of Uma, somehow the atmosphere matching the mournful story he was reading.\n\nAccording to the notes, Uma was a trainer and part-time script consultant at the same fitness center where Irving, the suspect, also trained. Both typically scheduled their workouts late in the evening, customarily ending when the gym was mostly vacant. The evening Uma met her untimely demise, irrefutable evidence shows Irving stayed later than she did, apparently relishing the solitude. The stark lighting of the closed gym only added to the chilly atmosphere.\n\nWinston carefully sipped his coffee, the bitter taste pulling him from his reverie. Grabbing his notepad, he jotted down a few points to discuss with Irving. Apart from his regular gym routine, various aspects of his writing career were catching Winston's eye.\n\nIrving was known for his precise work on scripts, specifically for his detailed research into harmful substances, even down to their handling and utilization. His alarmingly realistic work had earned him a strange kind of reputation, though no one could deny it fascinated viewers.\n\nGiven this, Uma’s claim that Irving stole her work didn’t seem so far off. Looking closely at her file again, Winston found a direct threat from Uma stating she would expose Irving's deception to the public. It seemed like this plagiarism accusation had Irving on edge, a tension that seemed to whisper of something dangerous. \n\nHeading out of the diner, Winston decided to head over to Irving’s apartment. It was a short drive, the buildings looming against the gloomy sky forebodingly, each window alight as though the eyes of some unseen spectators.\n\nAs he approached the building, he recalled a report of Irving carrying a vial from his car to his apartment. The vial itself seemed ordinary but combined with his previous online purchases of corrosive substances from a store, it painted a grim picture.\n\nUpon reaching the apartment, his observational skills kicked in, the detective noting the absence of lights; Irving had not yet returned home. His mind wandered back to the fitness center, and the reports claiming that Irving usually stayed late rang even truer considering the current time.\n\n\"Hey, Winston,\" barked a voice over the phone, pulling him back to reality. \n\n\"Irving went home, got caught in the morning traffic. You guess what he drove?\"\n\nWinston sighed, the picture painfully clear. \"I'm guessing it was a car.\"\n\n\"Well, today's just full of surprises for you, innit? Yeah, it was the car,\" the officer on the other line chuckled before he hung up.\n\nWinston leaned against the chilling wall, thoughts whirling around in his mind, the proverbially web becoming denser with each passing moment. Irving had a lot to answer for, and that included what happened the tragic night Uma was murdered.\n\nWinston had been to countless crime scenes before, seen unimaginable horrors, yet the fitness center was an unusual one. Uma, one of the well-known fitness enthusiasts had died an inexplicable death. While the cause of her demise was a vial of some sort of acid, the question of 'who?' lingered. He got to work, starting with the first person on his suspect list - Addison, Uma's trainer.\n\nAddison was a common sight at the fitness center, employed as a personal trainer. He always had a smile for everyone, but today, his face held a grimace. \"Not the best day, huh?\" Winston began, attempting to ease into the conversation. \n\nAddison shrugged, his customary smile replaced with a glowering look. Winston pondered silently also absorbing the sight of Addison's custom-made suit. Just a few days ago, Addison had showcased it during a workout demonstration at the fitness center. Quite an unlikely expenditure for a trainer, he thought, especially considering the known fact that Addison was not particularly well paid for his occupation.\n\n\"You remember working with Uma?\" Winston questioned. Addison nodded, confirming that Uma was indeed one of his regular clients. He also mentioned how Uma had once publicly praised his honesty. The irony of the statement was not lost on Winston. There were rumors, after all, that it was Uma who had caught Addison stealing expensive equipment from the gym. \n\n\"Equipment going missing recently?\" The question was straightforward, and Addison's look confirmed the hunch. Addison admitted to the gym's problem with missing expensive equipment, his face darkening considerably. The management had also noticed the problem, apparently. Winston suppressed the urge to connect the dots, to voice his suspicions, but rather, he asked brighter questions. Like if Addison ever needed to travel for work, to which the management and Addison himself confirmed that his job did not entail any work-related travel.\n\nThere was the security footage, of course. Addison entering the gym, nonchalantly, almost cheerfully, shortly before Uma's death. And more importantly, Addison was present in the fitness center at the time of the murder. That was no secret. And yet all Winston could outwardly do was take in the facts as they came, not utter a word about his growing suspicions. \n\n\"Quite a suit you've got,\" Winston finally commented at the end of their conversation, his gaze traveling over the custom-made suit that Addison had shown off in his recent work presentation. Addison just nodded, a baleful look crossing his face, as Winston, satisfied for the time, bade him goodbye.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Irving\nB.

His attention was fixed on the Irving case, a case that kept him on his toes for several days now. A screenwriter suspected in the murder of a fellow gym goer. He couldn’t help but feel the increasing pressure of the time crunch.\n\nIrving was not an ordinary man. Winston had discovered from the interviews and police records that the guy particularly had some weird habits. Irving, it seemed, was battling insomnia and was unable to sleep in his own home at night. During these restless nights, he would busy himself with his notebooks. Often, he was seen at the fitness center, sketching intriguing symbols into his notebook, which he always carried along with his pencil. He would leave home with these immediately after sunset.\n\nOne specific detail that struck the detective was Irving's fascination with themes and symbols of the past, particularly those formed by ancient gravestones. These ancient symbols were found in notations and sketches strewn across his notebooks. It was curious to Winston how an old world art found a home in the hands of a modern screenwriter.\n\nHis insomniac late-night habits weren't the only thing that raised suspicions, though. Irving also was a member at the same fitness center Uma frequented, spotted regularly training late into the night. The very same fitness center that was the scene of the crime. The records substantiated his presence late on the night of the murder. Like the deceased Uma, he seemed to utilized the solitude that the near-empty gym provided, allowing him ample time alone.\n\nThe lines on Winston's forehead became more pronounced as he read on. He found a strange connection between both Uma's and Irving's lives. Not only did they work out at the same gym, but they also shared a professional conflict. Reports indicated that Uma had discovered Irving's success was largely built on her own work which he'd plagiarized. Fearing public humiliation and the definite demise of his screenwriting career, Irving had a lot to lose. To make matters worse for Irving, Uma, the aggrieved, had threatened to expose his deceit to the public.\n\nThe tension of the case was truly weighing on Winston. He sighed, leaning back from his desk. Questions in his mind demanded answers that weren't there yet. So, he decided to continue with the investigation, waiting for the breakthrough that would add some clarity to the clouded picture. He had a late-night meeting with the prime suspect, Irving, in the pipeline. It was indeed time to probe further and extract some answers from the silence of the night.\n\nIn the busy forensics lab, Winston was studying the crime scene photos in silence. A woman named Uma, well known for her steadfast commitment to a fitness regimen, was the unfortunate victim. She was murdered during her normal workout hours.\n\nThe cops had discovered her body at the local fitness center, unease casting dark shadows over the typically vibrant atmosphere. Addison, a dual-timer as a gym trainer and a science teacher, was the main person of interest in the case.\n\nA patrol had brought in Addison's home chemistry set for further forensic analysis. An array of flasks, test tubes and a considerable stash of acid were lying on the evidence table, leading Winston to deduce that Addison frequently stored acid at home. \n\nWinston picked up his coat and made his way to the fitness center to meet with Addison. As he entered, the atmosphere was electric with loud pop music, the clang of weights, and the hum of treadmills.\n\n\"Addison?\" called Winston. A fit, somewhat skittish-looking man responded and confirmed his identity.\n\n\"Do you bring your chemistry set to this gym, Addison?\" Winston asked casually.\n\n\"Yes, I sometimes show the gym kids some simple experiments. I've even brought the acid over for demonstrations. You know, for pH tests and stuff. Harmless fun,\" Addison confessed, noticeably uncomfortable under Winston's scrutiny.\n\nAddison worked at the gym during the hours one Uma preferred for her workout, a fact the detective noted well. When questioned about Uma, his personal training client, Addison turned a shade paler. He was present during her murder.\n\nHe brought up the gym safe next: \"You've been seen accessing it?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I... um, take cash out for gym expenses,\" Addison stammered, betraying some nervousness.\n\nWinston knew that the gym had recently faced some financial discrepancies. The discrepancies had coincided with Addison's tenure at the gym. It was also not lost on Winston that coincidentally Uma had discovered Addison's theft only days before her murder. This fact added a new depth of motive to his crime profile.\n\nWith his thanks, Winston left Addison in deafening silence, leaving him to mull over the implications. Each fact snugly fit into the puzzle he was solving, but the sheer absurdity of the circumstances was distressing.

Remnants of police tape lingered in corners, while somber-touches reminders of what had happened to Isaac still hung in the air.\n\nHe was here to interview Milton, a well-known landlord in the vicinity and interestingly enough, an aficionado of funeral practices. As a testament to the latter, he often locked himself away to watch documentaries about funeral practices, a behavior reported by several tenants. Milton's fascination was no secret.\n\nWinston stepped into Milton's office, spotting a wall lined with framed contents. Among them was a gun license, recently issued by the local authorities - a fitting addition, given that Milton had passed all mandatory firearms training courses.\n\nOddly enough, Milton was seated behind his desk clad in a sharp, well-cut black suit. This wasn't out of character though; this was a man known for appearing overdressed for simple occasions. In fact, a tenant had once mentioned that Milton regularly shops for coats and ties at funeral shops.\n\nWinston spotted a shotgun in a corner, a disturbing sight considering it was the same type specified in the coroner's report for Isaac's death. It was an intriguing piece of evidence, considering Milton owns the shotgun.\n\nTheir conversation veered into various topics, with Milton highlighting his passion for reading. His bookshelf was lined with an extensive collection of books on death rituals from around the world - yet another proof of his peculiar interests. \n\nIn the midst of their conversation, Isaac's name came up. Following reliable sources, Winston knew something crucial - Isaac had stumbled upon evidence directly implicating Milton in a tax evasion scheme. Isaac, the ever-vigilant whistleblower, was preparing to expose Milton's scandalous scheme - a revelation that could land Milton in prison.\n\nAs Winston left the fitness center, he pondered on his findings. Milton's tax evasion scheme, his interest in funeral practices, the shotgun license, the matching murder weapon... it all seemed to connect. He was confident that the tax evasion evidence would be enough to send Milton to jail, but for now, only time would tell. It was just another day on the job for Winston. As for Milton, his fate hung in the balance.\n\nDetective Winston studied the scene: shattered glass, blood splatter, and scattered workout equipment telling a silent story. The fitness center wasn't the usual type of crime scene he found himself in. He sighed deeply and headed over to his prime suspect: Alice.\n\nAlice was just a stone's throw away from the crime scene. Staring blankly with pale, emotionless eyes. In her hand, a shotgun; paperwork indicating a fresh purchase tucked within its case, valid purchase documents all checked out at the base.\n\nWinston approached Alice cautiously and asked, \"You know Isaac's workout routine, correct? The list of Isaac's routines you've given us earlier... it matches the information we gathered. You both were here all the time.\" \n\nShocked by the sudden personal query, Alice confessed, \"We workout together, Winston. At least... we used to.\"\n\nWinston's eyes flickered to the shotgun slackly rested in Alice's lap. \"Been a while since I've seen a lady with a new piece like this.\"\n\nAlice was quick to correct him, \"Not to boast, Winston, but I've been handling such arms ever since my military days.\"\n\nDespite the grim predicament, Winston could tell Alice was trying to be cooperative. She was calm, composed; despite the whole flare-up. He moved on to the next line of questioning, \"Your son... he interacted often with Isaac?\"\n\nAlice appeared apprehensive before finally admitting, \"Recently, yes... He told me Isaac threatened him. Isaac... he acted aggressively towards my boy often.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston stammered, not wanting to press Alice too hard. He asked a softer question to lighten the mood, \"You often workout together then?\"\n\nAlice looked surprised and retorted mockingly, \"Is it that weird? We were the members of the same fitness center after all.\"\n\nBefore Winston could continue his questioning, he was handed a document by one of his officers. It read Isaac’s name and the note of a restraining order filed against him by a previous ex-partner. It seemed complicating factors always came in multiples in cases such as this.\n\nWithout keeping Alice in the dark, he disclosed the information with her, “A restraining order, and a school expulsion due to fighting incidents... Isaac seemed to have some rough patches in the past, huh?”\n\nAlice turned her head and acknowledged Winston's statement with a slight nod, her lips sealed shut.\n\nWinston wasn't sure why, but he felt the need to reassure her and said, \"We're in this together, Alice. We'll figure it out. If Isaac was threatening your son, then we can't overlook any facet of the situation.\"\n\nSeeing Alice with a newly purchased shotgun in her possession and catching onto bits of their relationship, Winston tried to figure out the puzzle, leaving no stone unturned. The interview with Alice wasn't offering any easy solutions, but Winston knew the case was anything but such.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Milton\nB.

The murder weapon? An unlikely and gruesome choice, a flamethrower.\n\n\nDetective Winston noticed Alfred almost immediately at the motel tournament. Not only because Alfred was a stellar athlete known for his flamethrower skills, but also due to his nonchalant display of his large, mysterious tool bag. This was particularly noticeable each time Winston spotted him leaving the motel on full moon nights, ready for a game. \n\nWinston approached Alfred after he ended yet another victorious game under the full moon. \"Alfred, right?\" Winston diplomatically asked. \n\n\"Yep, that's me.\" Alfred replied, a hint of pride mirroring in his words. The detectable pride wasn't out of place considering Alfred always seemed to score the winning point on the nights the moon was full.\n\n\"And you always play on full moon nights, right?\" Winston inquired, relying on his prior knowledge of the tournament's nature.\n\nAlfred answered, chuckling a bit to himself, \"A little superstitious, I guess. I do always seem to score the winning point when the moon's full.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Winston became aware of an oversized tool bag resting near Alfred's feet. He couldn't ignore the temptation of questioning, \"That's a pretty big bag you got there Alfred, what do you use that for?\"\n\nAlfred paused, \"Well.., it's for my flamethrower. They don't just hand those out to anyone, you know. I'm a pro at handling them.\"\n\nLater that evening, the police received a tip about the tool bag. Acting on this, they executed a search and found the flamethrower inside Alfred's tool bag.\n\nThe mention of a flamethrower took Winston aback, considering its relation to the crime, but he returned his focus to their conversation. \"I heard the motel hosts your team's meetings, correct?\"\n\nAlfred nodded, \"That's right, usually in Adam’s room. He'd let us use his room because it was more spacious.\"\n\nNoticing a key on a hoop attached to Alfred's bag, Winston asked, \"And that key, would that be to Adam's room?\"\n\nTaken by surprise, Alfred replied, \"Yeah, I suppose it is... he'd given me and the other team members a spare. We had the tournament here. Every full moon night you'd see me leaving with this bag and the key to Adam's room to hit the field.\"\n\nWinston remembered confirming that very fact from the official schedule he had reviewed at the precinct. Winston excused himself promising to catch the next game. As he left, he kept a watchful eye on Alfred, particularly when he was set to leave for the games on the nights of the full moon, and his unusually conspicuous tool bag.\n\nWinston sat at the corner of the dimly lit motel bar nursing a whiskey neat, his eyes periodically scanning the room in sharp, calculated movements. Earlier in the day, he had confirmed with his latest suspect, Gregory, that this was indeed the motel where Adam had been staying the night of the murder.\n\nTurning his gaze to the last row of whiskey bottles on the backlit shelf, he saw the reflection of a familiar figure making his way to the counter. Interestingly, when he'd questioned the locals in his investigation, they'd claimed to have seen Gregory nearby the motel bar on the night Adam was killed. Seeing Gregory now in the same bar seemed to affirm their claims.\n\nGregory was an older man, a veteran, disciplined and proud. His home was a menagerie of functional military memorabilia, everything from gun replicas to deactivated grenades. Among his collection was an impressively well-maintained flamethrower, understandably a surreal sight. But it was common among veterans like Gregory to go through great lengths to preserve the physical memories of their service. Gregory himself had been trained in the use of such weapons during his time in the military.\n\n\"Hey, what's a whiskey neat run you in a place like this?\" Winston asked, breaking the silence that had instinctively shrouded Gregory at the sight of him.\n\nThe barmaid laughed, glancing up at the chalkboard behind her. \"You're holding it, detective.\"\n\n\"Ah, that I am.\" Winston responded, leaning in closer.\n\nGregory had known Adam was staying at this motel. In fact, it was Adam himself that told him so. However, the two of them weren't what you'd call good friends. A distinct air of tension traced the edges of their relationship.\n\nAdam was privy to a secret of Gregory's. A secret that, if revealed, could sour Gregory's reputation beyond repair. It wasn't just idle gossip either. Adam had managed to procure evidence of Gregory's transgressions.\n\nNo, they weren't friends. Gregory had offered Adam money to keep his secret. Instead of growing quiet out of greed, Adam was currently residing in the morgue as the latest puzzle for Winston.\n\nDespite the severity of Gregory's secret, it was clear that there was more to the matter. This was simply one part of a larger, more intricate tapestry. A single lead in the looming, grey landscape of Winston's ongoing investigation into Adam's murder.\n\nWinston finished his whiskey and slammed the empty glass onto the bar, rising from his seat and stretching. It was time to return to his never-ending game of interviews and detective work. He cast one last glance at the mirror behind the bar, his eyes lingering on the reflection of Gregory.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Gregory\nB.

These didn't belong to any doctor, but were registered to a nurse called Emma, interestingly, the sister of the victim, Daniel.\n\n\"Always had a knack for playing nurse,\" said a neighbor when Winston asked about Emma. \"From a young age, she was determined to study medicine.\"\n\nHowever, her medical history was not as clean as expected. Winston discovered Emma had defended herself in a lawsuit regarding medical misconduct. It appeared her passion for medicine wasn't enough to cleanse her record.\n\nWinston decided to pay a visit to Emma's workplace. Emma seemed to run the show there, in charge of taking care of numerous patients, one of them being her brother, Daniel. She had unlimited access to both patient rooms and supplies, owing to her profession.\n\nAfter Daniel fell ill, Emma had taken over his day-to-day care. Winston observed the level of meticulousness in her work, seen in the daily schedules she maintained for Daniel, providing an insight into his routine.\n\nA closer inspection of the documents revealed certain falsifications in the medical entries. Emma’s writing gave her away as the one who manipulated these records.\n\nDaniel was scheduled to testify at court, a fact evident through multiple subpoenas discovered at his residence. The case was against his own sister, Emma, in relation to medical malpractice. Winston made a note of the court date; it was unnervingly close. His hunch said that this information was not to be disregarded.\n\nEmma was the one who planned out the trip to the zoo, Winston found. A visit to the zoo was calming therapy for her bed-ridden brother... at least it usually.\n\nWinston could still envision the terrible scene at the zoo where Daniel had been found lifeless, an eerie death brought on by a medical syringe. Nothing in the vicinity suggested the presence of a murderer except for a couple of eyewitnesses who had spotted Emma around the same time as the murder.\n\nHis last stop was the hospital, where he bumped into Emma finishing her shift. Daniel had been under her care at this very facility. It was clear to Winston that the system trusted her and she held sway in her workplace. \n\nWinston had more questions but he left them for another day. The facts had certainly pointed him to interesting possibilities that had to be pursued diligently. It was a murder that he could sense ran deeper than it appeared.\n\nWinston gingerly stepped into the blurry morning light. His first port of call, the infamous Zoo where Daniel's life was abruptly cut short. As he made his way past the monkey enclosure, a bright red hat peeked out from a treetop. Daniel's hat. No doubt he had been here, but what was he doing in the primate area?\n\nWinston took a step back and scanned the area. His gaze fell upon the makeshift wooden bar tucked away by the corner. That's when he noticed Amelia setting up her bar, placing various liquor bottles in their places, stacking the glasses precisely in her own thirsty manner. Amelia, the bartender from the watering hole Daniel frequented, had begun her day at the zoo early that morning. \n\nSuddenly, the memory of the previous night flashed before Winston's eyes. He remembered seeing Daniel, chatty and jovial as ever at Amelia's bar. This was before the incident, before the silence surrounded by chaos. \n\nWith determined steps, Winston hurried over to Amelia's regular bar in the city. As he walked in, he observed the familiar locale. The cracks in the wall, the faded posters. The painting hanging on the wall of Amelia's home was exactly the same. A violent brawl depicted in the same bar, reflecting Amelia's artistic license in her paintings. A perfect replica of the bar, complete with each minute crack in the wall was stroked with such precision that it sent a shiver down his spine. Amelia, an artist by morning, illustrating the violence that would occur by night.\n\nAll of a sudden, a piercing screech emanated from a nearby enclosure. Winston, startled, quickly turned around and realized it was lunchtime at the zoo. Staff were feeding the animals. Among the staff was Amelia, wielding a small syringe, proficiently sedating an agitated monkey. Winston drew a sharp breath, recalling her proficiency with syringes, the odd weapon of choice in Daniel's murder.\n\nAmelia noticed the detective at nearly the same instant and walked over. Her spunky red hair tied back into a ponytail, her bright green eyes challenging him. Amelia wasn't your typical bartender.  \n\"Brings you quite early today, Winston? Can I get you something to drink?\" Amelia smirked, avoiding any informative conversation. \n\n\"Was Daniel here yesterday?\" Winston probed, ignoring her question. \n\n\"Sure, he got in around the afternoon.\" Amelia paused, glancing at the post-midday sun. \"Anything else you want to?\",\nWinston decided to dig a bit more, \"What time did you close last night, Amelia? Any company?\"\n\n\"Late, as always. I'm alone after hours, you know.\" Amelia shrugged carelessly as she took a small canvas out from behind the bar counter, ready to continue her post-work painting ritual.\n\nAmelia, the artist who moonlighted as a bartender, and a skillful one at that. Winston thought to himself. She defensively guarded her solitary space, applying her painting skills onto canvas after hours, but one whose depictions were less than tranquil.\n\nWith his visit done, Winston tipped his hat off to Amelia and moved on for the day, leaving a nervous bartender in her wake.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

She wore the hardened expression of a seasoned miner, and a sprinkle of white dust beaded her forehead. She had, years ago, spent a considerable amount of time underground before she traded the pickaxe for a ring. Even after her marriage, however, Winston knew that Marianne was not unfamiliar with the heft and purpose of such a tool.\n\nHis eyes consisted of the audit papers laid out before him, declaring a significant debt that Marianne owed in back taxes. She was circling financial demise, and the state was closing in. Then, his eyes shifted to the statement provided by a friend of hers, highlighting her strong assertion that she would rather perish than get sent behind bars. It seemed to Winston that Marianne was still filled with the spirits of the old miners, willing to risk it all in pursuit of her own freedom.\n\nHis venture out to her parcel of land a few days back had stamped the image in his mind of her mining tools lounging out in the open. They were well-kept and clean, the way old miners kept their tools. Marianne had been spotted around the community with the pickaxe, using it for various garden works and general maintenance.\n\nNow Winston's attention moved to Wendy, the victim, an honest lady known for her earnest ways. She was found in a sequestered section of the roller rink, a roller skate still hanging onto her foot as if she was frozen mid-skate.\n\nPlacing a call, Winston requested the CCTV footage of the roller rink from the night of the murder. There, in the flickering low resolution, was Wendy locked in a heated argument with Marianne. The dispute ended and Wendy skated off, but Marianne stayed.\n\nLater, another clip showed Marianne lingering along the outskirts, long after the other skaters had left. It was an eerie sight - the roller rink was empty, except for the flickering neon lights and Marianne, circling the rink with an unsettling calmness.\n\nWinston slid an envelope towards himself and carefully extracted a photograph. It was Wendy's last piece of brave detective work - a picture of Marianne caught in a grim action that served as undeniable proof of her crime. But it was Wendy, with her unwavering integrity, who held this tight to her chest, vowing to expose the truth about Marianne.\n\nTwo cups of coffee empty, Winston switched off the lights and left the room. The image of Marianne and the pickaxe lingered in the darkness of the office, the unsaid words and whispers of the CCTV footage bouncing off the walls. The unwelcome truth seemed to have found a perfect partner with the impending dawn, unflinching and relentless.\n\nPencil in hand, a room full of boxes filled with countless pads of stationary and envelopes, Winston scrolled through the dossier one more time. Sidney, the geologist who loved to write letters and the company of a well-worn roller rink.\n\nWinston headed to the local rink to further his investigation. The sticky, stale scent of overused roller skates greeting him as he walked in. The roller rink was bustling with murmurs about the murder that had taken place there the previous night during Sidney's usual hours at the rink, further thickening the air with tension.\n\nThe staff recognized him the second he walked through the door. \"Detective Winston,\" they greeted. \"Come about the Sidney matter?\" \n\nWinston nodded, face impassive, “He’s a regular around here, isn’t he? And he was here last night too?\"\n\n“Heck, we'd see him here every other night, including last night,” one replied. \"Always came in right around the same time.” Winston noted the staff’s response verbatim.\n\n“And this uh…Wendy? Seen her around with Sidney?” \n\nPausing, a staff member nodded. \"Yes, they've been seen together few times at the rink. Wendy told us she knew a secret about Sidney, something that could humiliate him if it got out and that she already shared this secret with her friends. In fact, the secret she told was indeed damaging; it was about Sidney's misconduct in his reputable profession that if revealed, would certainly ruin him publicly.\"\n\nThe information tucked away in his mind, Winston thanked the rink staff. He turned his mind to Jack, Sidney’s imprisoned friend with notorious criminal record.\n\nHe walked out to his car, rummaging for his mobile, tapped a number. \"Yes, I need to speak with Jack. Yes, the one in cell 108.\"\n\nThe next stop was the post office, where stacks upon stacks of letters, each written by Sidney using his large collection of stationary and postage stamps could be seen. \"Yeah, he's in here often,” the postmistress shared without hesitation. \n\nWinston mulled over this, pocketed his notepad, and headed to Sidney's home with a stern knock on the door.\n\nSidney let him in, launching into endless stories involving Jack as if it were an unconcerned topic. But when Wendy's name dropped, his jovial manner evaporated and his demeanor drastically changed. \"That's a lie!\" Sidney protested vehemently when Winston cautiously picked up the subject Wendy had told her friends involving a ruinous secret that's been said she knew about Sidney. \"She had no idea what she was talking about. All her talk was to intentionally defame me in public.\" The denial was fervent, almost desperate.\n\nWinston offered no consolation. It wasn’t his job. He stepped away from Sidney’s house, a new puzzle piece in hand. His work, the unraveling of the truth, was far from done.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Marianne\nB.

He sat back and scratched his chin thoughtfully as it fell into place with the CCTV footage - Skylar and Mya entering the rainforest alone.\n\nMaking a note of this, he remembered another piece of CCTV footage from two days back, showing Mya packing for what seems to be a camping trip. The footage included one notable item within her gear – a lead pipe, distinct because Mya seemed to pay particular attention to it.\n\nHe decided to pay a visit to Mya. She was found at her regular gym, her movements were fluid and strong as she exercised, her biceps straining under the weight. She was in a very good shape, her fitness wasn't in question, that was sure. As she rested between sets, Winston approached her.\n\n“Excuse my interruption,\" Winston began, \"I’ve read that you’ve completed quite a few hiking and mountain climbing expeditions?”\n\nA look of surprise flashed on her face, She nodded, panting a bit. “Yes, I’ve been fortunate enough to get around…” she replied.\n\n“You met up with Skylar for a camping trip recently?” Winston probed, her eyes flickered away, a troubled expression crossing her face. “Yes, Skylar invited me.\"\n\n\"I understand there’s been tension in the family recently,\" Winston strayed towards less comfortable territories. \"Skylar had revealed something personal about you to your family, is that right?\"\n\n\"The accusation about a family heirloom…\" Mya tensed, glancing sharply at Winston,\"That was absolutely baseless. Skylar had no reason to accuse me.” She visibly wilted, there was an anger in her voice, fueled by embarrassment. “It’s been a dark chapter in my life.”\n\nWinston nodded, understanding. He had been briefed about Skylar revealing Mya's secret and how the family had started ostracizing her due to the false accusation.\n\nAs Mya picked up her gym bag to leave, Winston noticed her camping gear in the open compartment. The video registered in his mind. The roll of duct tape, an aluminum water bottle, a headlamp but the lead pipe was missing. The same lead pipe that was seen on the CCTV footage when she was packing. It was a small detail but something that stuck with Winston.\n\nOutside the gym, as Winston leaned against his car, one fact bore heavily on his mind - no other cars had been recorded entering or leaving the rainforest by any of the surveillance teams on the day Skylar had been killed. This little nugget of fact had been disturbing him the entire day.\n\nWinston's face hardened while he made the drive back to his office. His mind was whirling; he needed to look at the bigger picture. He was only making sense of each piece that he was uncovering. Whatever was happening was complex, and he had a lot of facts to untangle.\n\nWinston strolled past the line of cabs parked near the city center. He had a destination in mind - the beaten grey vehicle at the end. The driver, Albert, was in the middle of a losing battle with his customer inflow. Not that the local populace didn't patronize taxis. In fact, Skylar was the sweetheart of the city, everyone in town loved her and seemed to prefer her company rather than Albert’s. \n\n“Albert, have some free time for a chat?” Winston asked as he leaned into the cab’s open window. \n\nAlbert’s gaze didn’t leave the rear-view mirror, covered with a pile of sunglasses. “Not like I have a lot of customers waiting, detective,” he grumbled.\n\n\"Skylar seemed to be collecting quite a few of your regulars. You seemed to think she was taking away your livelihood. Did you know her well?\" Winston inquired, ignoring Albert's bitter tone. \n\nAlbert's eyebrows furrowed as he fixated on the cab’s ornament-studded dash. \"We met a few times. I was her cab driver for the day. Imagine the luck.”\n\n“Skylar requested you to drive her to the rainforest that day, didn’t she?”\n\nAlbert gave a quick nod, the beginnings of sweat forming on his forehead. \"Yes, and I took a detour. Figured it would save time.” \n\nWinston glanced at the windshield, spotting an almost perpetual darkness, and turned back towards Albert. \"You always drive at night, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, and?\" Albert's defensive demeanor wasn’t hard to miss. \n\n\"No reason,\" Winston mused, shifting to open up his field of vision. “I find it interesting,” he moved on, \"because you have a large collection of shades. You know, considering your night job and all…\" \n\nAlbert laughed, a hollow sound echoing in the cab. \"I don't even know what you mean by light sensitivity, detective.”\n\nWith a nod, Winston changed topics, \"Did you notice anything strange about Skylar that day? Anything about her demeanor?\"\n\nAlbert scratched his cheek nervously, avoiding Winston's gaze. \"She seemed pretty normal to me.\"\n\n\"Have any issues making eye contact, for example?\" Winston asked, noticing that he himself hadn’t gotten much eye contact during the discussion. \n\nAlbert's laugh returned. It was hollow, yet somewhat nervous. “N-never been a fan, detective. Just a thing.”\n\n\"Alright, Albert. Thanks for your time.\" Winston straightened up, taking one last look at Albert and the cab before turning away. As far as anyone knew, nobody else was in the rainforest that day - it was just Albert, Skylar, and a host of unanswered questions. Winston had quite a lot to ponder over.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Albert\nB.

He took in every detail, from the treadmills dusted with sweat to the discarded water bottles. Heidi, the victim, chose to exercise late at night - but took a break from routine on the night she was shot, as informed by the gym staff.\n\nWinston pulled out his notepad, flicking through a list of Heidi's known associates. One name stood out - Grace, a longtime companion, or so the notes said. Alongside the role of being friends, they spent plenty of time together at the gym. First order of business, Winston decided- to seek out Grace. \n\nTracing her down wasn't a difficult task; she was on one of her frequent hunting trips. Winston found her in the wilderness, a shotgun in hand. Well, Winston thought to himself, looking at the weapon, she certainly had the means to cause harm. \n\nGrace herself was a curious dichotomy of strength and insecurity. Winston noticed her looking around anxiously, as if expecting someone else.  \n\n\"Interesting place for an exercise enthusiast,\" Winston commented nonchalantly, pointing at the shotgun. \"Helps with focus,\" Grace explained, but her voice was shaky, her eyes darting. \n\nConversation moved towards Heidi, with Winston carefully probing for information. Grace admitted to convincing Heidi to change her late-night workout on the fateful day. Her reason: she didn't like Heidi's new companion, John. \n\nJohn was well-liked, sociable - a stark contrast to Grace's reserved nature, Winston observed. Grace admitted feeling small around him, even confessed to her fear of losing Heidi to him. \n\n\"John... You mean Heidi's new beau?\" Winston asked, trying to sound as casual as possible. Grace nodded, her face turning a shade paler.\n\nParting ways, Winston had a good measure of Grace - someone for whom possessiveness was an umbrella under which she lived. \n\nBack in his car, Winston scrolled through Heidi's recent messages, courtesy of the police tech team. There he found a recent development too - Heidi was pursuing a relationship with John.\n\nThe chapter ended there with Winston sitting in his car reflecting on everything he had learned about Grace. Trying to reconcile the Grace who loved her friend Heidi, with the Grace who seemed threatened by the emergence of John in her friend’s life. All while a hunting trip loomed large in the backdrop.\n\nWinston had spent a better part of his life investigating murder cases, and the murder of Heidi felt quite familiar. She was killed by a shotgun, a chilling detail that was reminiscent of other cases he had investigated. Standing in the midst of the bustling fitness center which was once Heidi's second home, Winston found it hard to believe that this could be a crime scene.\n\nInterviewing the staff of the fitness center, Winston got to know about a new jockey, Chester who had joined the staff fortnight ago and also worked out regularly after his shifts. This was interesting, considering Chester was known at the nearby range for being an enthusiast shooter and admired for his handy use of a shotgun when hunting. Winston had seen Chester's gang in town, they were known troublemakers and more than once had been seen flashing their shotguns. A request to interview Chester was put forward.\n\nSoon they were both seated at the corner office of the fitness center. Nodding towards Chester’s arm, which clearly displayed a shotgun tattoo, Winston began the interview, “Heidi was a regular here. You must have noticed her during your workout sessions as well...” \n\n\"Yeah, I did. Quite dedicated she was,\" nodded Chester, \"Used to come in every day. I often saw her while I was working out after my shift.\" \n\n“Interesting. Can you tell me where you were at the time of Heidi's last known appointment at the fitness center?\" asked Winston.\n\n\"I was at the fitness center, I had started my shift at the same time as Heidi's last known appointment\", Chester replied.\n\nOn further inquiry, Chester admitted that he often comes across items that fitness center members, including Heidi, often misplace or even lose. In fact, he had a personal collection of these items which he casually pointed toward - a small box that contained a ring that Linda had reported as lost and a necklace that Tom had reported as stolen, among other things.\n\nJust as Winston was processing this information, he received a phone call from Linda and Tom. Both had earlier reported a loss of their respective items - a ring and a necklace. Their joyous news was that they had found their missing jewelry in a pawn shop, and that it was sold by Chester's gang, known to frequent the shop.\n\nDeep in thought about Chester, Heidi, the pawn shop, and the obscure pieces of this awful puzzle, Winston decided to keep a close eye on Chester and his gang, who surely had a lot more to reveal. He left the fitness center, preparing for another tense day of investigation.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Grace\nB.

Justin had been such a force in his team, respected, a captain among men, though some might say too powerful. Now his power was reduced to the echo of ice skates and a somber memorial created by a grieving fan base. Justin had been planning to retire soon. The season had been hard on the team, one loss after another piling on each other, and perhaps that weighted on Justin’s mind. He spent a lot of time at this rink, long hours practicing, lamenting, dwelling.\n\nAs cold as the rink was, Winston had another colder, less inviting place to visit - Lillian, a self-proclaimed follower of hockey and a big fan of Justin's team. She'd made her way to the rink too and spent a notable amount of time on the ice when the security cameras had proven to be faulty, no eyes spying her presence. The timing of her visits struck Winston as interesting. \n\nWinston arrived at the therapy center where Lillian was a patient. All around her, she saw various intriguing treatments - the use of ropes for exercise prominently in use. They seemed innocuous, everyday objects one wouldn’t look twice at in this setting, yet she had to remember that one such rope was the murder weapon. The center’s policies were loose, not closely monitoring rope use or restricting patients from borrowing it.\n\nShe found Lillian in one of the therapy rooms, working through her regimen, her face a mask of exerted effort as she battled her way through a routine with the ropes.\n\n“How are your sessions coming along, Lillian?” Winston asked. \n\nLillian paused, sweat glistening off her forehead. “It’s been therapeutic, they are helping me,\" she replied.\n\nWinston watched as Lillian resumed her therapy. She mused over a nugget of a conversation Lillian had with a friend she'd come across in her investigation. \"I would make a better captain than Justin,\" Lillian had bemoaned.\n\nWinston looked at Lillian, her determination in handling the ropes, her eyes set out on a possible future where she could fill Justin’s skates, and couldn’t help but think of how Justin’s power had irked Lillian.\n\nWinston walked away from the center, leaving Lillian to her thoughts and her rope therapy. But as she got in her car, she couldn't shake off the eerie feeling of rustling ropes echoing in the cold air of the rink and the fierce determination in Lillian’s eyes.\n\nInstinctively, Winston flipped open his notepad as he arrived at the local hockey rink. It was here, behind the rink, that Justin had been killed. His neighbors had mentioned an unusual quiet at his house recently, which stirred further suspicion. The place still held the cold dread one felt when faced with such an incident. He was here to talk to Yvette, the choreographer, a key witness who was present at the scene for the setup.\n\nA quick glance around the rink spotted her immediately. Yvette, poised and expressionless, stood at a distance overlooking the rink. Her stance reflected her dedication to her work - her reputation in choreography was indeed her lifeline. But her presence at the rink during Justin's murder raised alarms in Winston's mind.\n\n\"Yvette?\" Winston confirmed, striding across the rink to meet her.\n\n\"Yes, detective,\" she replied, her voice cool and composed.\n\n\"Busy day?\" Winston casually started, looking around the place.\n\n\"Always,\" Yvette conceded, then added almost immediately. \"I insist on having my private life, so I condense my work.\"\n\n\"Convenient,\" Winston thought aloud. \"And the dance studio? Neighbors said it's often closed. Unexpectedly.\"\n\nYvette paused before responding, \"My trips. I need them for my creative process.\"\n\nWinston nodded, letting a silence hang for a moment. \"Lot of work preparing for a show, huh?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\" Yvette replied with a trace of bitterness. \"Justin was actually set to give his speech during intermission. I saw an early draft. It was... brutal.\"\n\nWinston noticed the change in her tone. \"Against you?\"\n\nYvette nodded, adding, \"Justin was planning to insinuate that my choreographies were... stolen.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Winston’s eyes never left Yvette. Recalling the neighbors' remarks about the unusual quietness at her house, he pondered on it for a moment. But in the world of murder mysteries, nothing was clear cut. \"Well, I appreciate your cooperation, Yvette.\"\n\nHe left her standing there, on the ice. Earlier, he'd have viewed her differently, a choreographer, a creator. But facts were facts, and Yvette was found on the crime scene during Justin's murder.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Yvette\nB.

This wasn't going to be easy. All he currently had on record was that Rufus was at the fitness center on the day of his murder. Additionally, Rufus had confided in a friend he had noticed Sergio, the fitness center masseur, being unusually close to his wife. This same friend also reported Rufus's shock at finding a love letter from Sergio in his wife's purse - all in a scorned husband's day. Rufus's wife, a well-known socialite, could lose her reputation and wealthy status if the affair was made public - adding another layer of complexity to the case.\n\nTaking a final sip from his glass, he got up, nodded to the bartender, and swung his coat over his arm. He made his way towards the fitness center to meet the suspect. \n\nAs he walked into the bustling fitness center, he was immediately directed towards Sergio, who was idly flicking through a book on anatomy. Winston found it off that the man was more engrossed in the details of the human body than managing his massage schedule.\n\n\"You're Sergio?\" Winston asked, sitting opposite him. Sergio looked up and nodded, closing his textbook. They discussed briefly about his recent activities in the center - appointments, fitness tips, and updates about the clients. It turned out, Sergio had comprehensive knowledge when it came to the human body, as any masseur would. What was interesting though, was his knowledge extended beyond just massages. He had been a medical student once before switching his career path.\n\nIn the middle of the conversation, Winston subtly asked about Rufus's regular fitness schedule which Sergio nonchalantly acknowledged he was aware of. It made sense, given he was the regular masseur for Rufus.\n\nSergio then remembered. \"Oh! We had a massage appointment on the day of...his passing,\" he said, with a hint of sadness. It was not out of place considering they were discussing a dead person. But, Winston wound forward. \n\n\"The massage rooms here... They are quite private, yes?.\" Winston asked, looking around.\n\n\"Yes, indeed. Quite soundproof, too. Folks like their privacy while relaxing,\" Sergio answered, leading Winston to one of the rooms with a confident stride.\n\nThe conversation went on, deflecting towards his personal life. Winston learned about Sergio's passion for hunting and his extensive collection of hunting knives; sharp, ready for hunting. To his surprise, Sergio even showed him a photo of his collection, describing each knife as if it was a piece of art. \n\nConversation moved to love, wherein Sergio confessed his feelings for Rufus's wife, stating he didn't want to lose her. He even conceded that Rufus may have found out about their closeness when he found Sergio's love letter in his wife's purse - something that Rufus had picked up on.\n\nEnding the night with a ‘take care’ and a handshake, Winston walked out - his mind navigating through an array of new insights that deserved thorough analysis.\n\nA cup of black coffee stood before Winston as he analyzed a collected pile of credit card statements. \"What kind of astronaut reads this much?\" Winston murmurs to himself, noticing that most of the charges were made to the same handful of bookstores. Harvey, the astronaut in question, had been frequently spotted visiting these local bookstores. \n\nRobust and transparent discussions with those familiar with Harvey confirmed Winston's observations. Harvey's colleagues reported that despite his extensive reading, he often diverted any conversation to the topic of death, a subject he had a seemingly keen interest in even in a casual setting. \n\nWinston set the statements to the side and pulled out a notebook, turning to a page marked 'Harvey.' According to various circles, Rufus had some undisclosed material that could potentially harm Harvey's career. That was the real elephant in the room no one wanted to acknowledge. \n\nEarlier that month, Harvey had confided in Winston, voicing his fears about Rufus's potential leverage. \"I think Rufus is blackmailing me, Winston,\" Harvey had admitted, distressed by the situation.\n\nLater that day, he found himself at the local National Aeronautics and Space Administration center. Harvey was a trained astronaut, and Winston wanted to visit his training hall, where astronauts often used sharp objects as part of their tasks. The center was a maze of rooms where, amongst the astronaut tools, laid a hunting knife - a personal possession of Harvey's that Winston was familiar with. \n\nAt the training center, Winston was made aware of the physical and combat regimen undergone by astronauts such as Harvey. He saw the exact environment where Harvey honed his familiarity with these sharp objects during his extensive training. \n\nWinston spent the afternoon with Harvey over a cup of coffee at a local diner. Harvey fidgeted with his cup and looked around the room nervously at the mention of Rufus, confirming yet again how Rufus's potential blackmail had distressed him. \n\nEveryone expected Harvey to talk about the cosmos, space, and maybe the aliens he secretly hoped existed. Instead, he consistently returned the conversation to his favorite topic of death, a topic he apparently enjoyed discussing even more than his job as an astronaut.\n\nUnsettled by the interactions, Winston continued investigating and researched Harvey further. Harvey's credit card statements tied the pieces of the puzzle more tightly. Winston couldn't help but focus on the nervous demeanor Harvey displayed. Even as a hardened astronaut, whatever Rufus held over Harvey was enough to visibly shake his otherwise calm demeanor. The late-night study sessions continued... As did Winston's analysis, but answers continued to elude him.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Harvey\nB.

Beside the main floor was a separate storage area, cleverly concealed and invisible from the sales floor - tucked away in a quiet corner where no customer could see. Salesmen were bustling about, attempting to close deals and lure in unsuspecting customers. His gaze settled on a particular man, who was rather keenly explaining the mileage of a specific model to a customer: Miles.\n\n\"Mr. Miles,\" Winston greeted in his stern tone, interrupting the technical talk about mileage.\n\n\"Sorry, sir. I'm deep in a conversation,\" he said, not looking up from the customer.\n\n\"I believe this is more important,\" Winston replied, flashing his badge.\n\nMiles made an excuse to the customer and led Winston toward the hidden storage room, away from the prying eyes of the staff and customers. Entering the secretive area that no other employee had set foot in, Miles seemed visibly unnerved, surrounded by nothing but stacks of tires and car parts. \n\n\"Is there something wrong, detective?\" He asked, subtly glancing at the locked door behind him.\n\n\"Miles, I want to talk to you about Sophie. I understand you were both in the wrestling match. Quite the tough opponent you had there.\" Winston began. \n\nMiles cleared his throat, \"Well, we were more than just opponents in the ring. We've had our issues politically too.\"\n\n\"I'm aware,\" Winston said curtly, noticing Miles turning defensive.\n\n\"Sophie possessed evidence against you, she found out about money laundering carried out through this dealership, perhaps?\" Winston probed. \n\nMiles shifted uncomfortably; his complexion changed and he cast his eyes down nervously. \"I...I don't know what you're talking about, Detective.\" \n\nWinston sternly replied, \"Sophie planned to reveal these illegal acts. You knew it, didn’t you? She was about to expose your whole operation.”\n\n\"Anyone would want to protect their livelihood, Detective,” retorted Miles, avoiding Winston's piercing gaze.\n\n\"I see,\" Winston said calmly assessing the situation, \"It seems no one else knows what you do in this storage room Miles.\"\n\n“Well, it's my dealership, my storage. Do I need an audience now?\" Miles retorted, frustration creeping into his voice.\n\nDeciding to change gears a bit, Winston asked, \"Say, Miles, you sponsor anyone in Sophie's campaign?\"\n\n\"Actually I do, I have been secretly financing a competing candidate in Sophie's campaign.\" Revealed Miles with a mischievous grin, sensing no immediate danger. \n\n\"Ah, hedging your bets, are we?\" Winston concluded.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston said, ending the conversation. He finished up his lukewarm coffee, thanked Mr. Miles for his time, and walked out of the concealed storage room, leaving Miles behind in the stuffy room of tires and car parts. \n\nAs he meandered through the dealership, Winston thought about what Miles had said and not said. He stepped out into the parking lot, squinting against the harsh afternoon sun. He had a mystery to solve, and every lead mattered.\n\nWinston took another sip from his coffee cup as he shuffled through the files, his tired eyes narrowing on the name Willard, the initial suspect for the recent wrestling ring homicide. Sophie's death had hit the community like a brick wall, and the press swarmed around it like flies.\n\nSophie, a champion wrestler, was shot in the ring while performing one of her signature moves. The chaos of that night was still reported in the tabloids, time seemed to have stopped, and the investigation was now up to him.\n\nSophie had falsely accused Willard of malpractice, however, she won the court case. It was an incident that was the talk of the town. The accusations, though false, were ratified by court, leaving Willard's career as a chiropractor on thin ice. Winston remembered Willard's hands shaking at the courthouse, his eyes burning with something Winston could not quite pinpoint.\n\nSpotting Willard's front-row wrestling event ticket in the collected evidence file, Winston knew he had been there right at the heart of the event. It was well known that mandatory check-ins were required for attendees and part of Willard’s check-in document showed his presence at the entrance of the arena, confirming his presence at that fateful match. \n\nThe interviews had a common thread - Willard frequented the wrestling matches. Winston had found the receipts and tickets for each event annotated in Willard's handwriting; it was an unquestionable fact.\n\nDr. Willard's profile drew Winston's attention. His career as a chiropractor not only required him using protective tools like support belts and gloves, but also a familiarity with the human anatomy that would be advantageous in a wrestling match. It was especially Willard’s second career—his military background—that caught Winston’s eye. Winston had heard about Willard's long career in the army. The firearm training he got there pulled him back to the murder.\n\nPoring over reports again, Winston recalled that Willard carried a firearm for protection. The firearm was engraved into the case's backbone, another undeniable fact that Winston had to grapple with. \n\nHe took a deep breath and decided to pay Willard a visit. \n\nMeeting Willard at his office, Winston perched himself on the edge of the chiropractic table, looking at the protective gloves and belts hanging on the wall, it was evident that his chiropractic practice required these safety tools. Winston could see Willard's tension, the hint of uncontrollable worry seeping from his face. He handed over his business card to Willard.\n\n\"So, Willard, you were at the wrestling match the night Sophie was shot?\" Winston asked.\n\nWillard nodded, \"Yes, I was there... I... I usually go to watch the matches. I had a front-row ticket.\"\n\nWinston opened his notepad, marking it down. \"The court case, it was... tough on you, wasn't it?\" He asked.\n\nWillard swallowed, nodding again without a word. \n\nWinston stood up to leave, passing a quick glance over the firearms manual lying on the shelf, and pocketed his notepad. He didn't know if he had all the answers, but he was determined to find the truth.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Willard\nB.

Home explosions were not commonly dealt with in his line of work, though he knew very well that such explosives were often used in demolitions. \n\nWith such knowledge, he was reminded of a local surfing instructor who also took part in an unconventional part-time job that would put him in frequent touch with explosives, training weekly on handling and disposal. This wasn't his usual surfing job but his part-time work as a demolition worker. This was no doubt, Patrick.\n\nFinding his interview notes with Patrick, Winston decided it was time to speak with him again. Winston had known Patrick through his work, not because he surfed but because of his other role in demolition, an occupation that naturally involved a great deal of work with explosives.\n\nWinston set off to the beach in search of Patrick, eventually spotting him as he was patiently teaching a young boy how to ride the waves. \"Patrick!\" he called out to him.\n\nRecognizing Winston, the man navigated back to shore on his surfboard with a practised ease. \"Detective Winston,\" he greeted, wiping the saltwater off his face. \"How can I help you?\"\n\n\"Just a few questions,\" Winston replied. He opened his notebook to a page of carefully penned notes about Patrick's financial troubles. \"I heard that you've been having some trouble... getting into a failed investment, left with a sizeable debt?”\n\nPatrick's face tightened, but he nodded in admission. \"That's right. Lost all my savings, even borrowed a huge amount from Angela, but the investment went under.\"  \n\n\"Angela had been lending you money, huh?\" Winston asked, wanting to confirm the loan from Angela. \"And you haven't been able to pay her back because you lost your main job?\"\n\n“That’s correct, detective,” the man answered, his face grim with the weight of his troubles.\n\n\"Angela ever threaten to, oh, say, call the police on you?\" Winston casually asked, inspecting the worn strap of his watch.\n\nPatrick hesitated before finally sighing and admitting, \"Yes, she did. More than once. I guess she had enough of my money problems and empty promises.\"\n\nSomewhat satisfied, Winston took down the latest confession. Glancing around the beach, he then asked, \"You were around Angela's house the evening of the explosion?\" \n\n\"Detective... it's not far from here, I often pass by when I go home,\" Patrick replied, his face tense at the questioning.\n\n\"Well, nobody else was around her place at that time,\" Winston mentioned, \"Just an interesting fact.\"\n\nIn the awkward silence that followed, Winston then asked about the part that bothered him the most. \"You use explosives much with your part-time work and your frequent training, Patrick?\" \n\nPatrick seemed to straighten, “I have, yes, in controlled environments and with appropriate permits.” His voice was firm, perhaps a little defensive.\n\n\"Right, part of the job, I guess,\" Winston nodded, closing his notebook. Not another word was spoken between them as he walked away, leaving a nervous Patrick behind.\n\nWinston gave a slow pull from his coffee as he sat across from Alvin, the typically even-tempered delivery man whose vehicle was loaded and ready for his daily route through town. Alvin's calm demeanor had earned him a reputation among the townsfolk as reliable, if not a tad peculiar due to his habit of having his lunch beside graves. \n\nAlvin's reliable routine encompassed the entire town including the cemetery - on today's agenda, he'd be stopping at Angela's to drop off a package. His daily routines had put him on a first-name basis with Angela, as she always made a point to personally welcome him into her home when he arrived with her deliveries. \n\n\"So Alvin, any big plans for today?\" Winston asked, making casual conversation. \"Oh yes,\" Alvin replied, a spark in his usually placid eyes. \"I've just bought a vintage Victorian-era coffin from an auction. Also, I am picking up some decommissioned explosives from a contact in the military. They're for a historical display I'm working on. Can't wait to get both set up in the living room.\"\n\nThis interest didn't surprise Winston. Alvin was known to frequent antique shops, specifically those that boasted a range of mortuary relics. It was odd, sure, but Alvin being odd was one of the few things that gave him character. \n\n\"Did you know Angela?\" he asked Alvin in a low tone, a hint of suspicion in his voice. Alvin nodded, \"Yes. I deliver her packages regularly. Also,\" he said after a pause, \"I was due to deliver a package to her today.\"\n\nThat tidbit of information Winston knew. Angela was home that day to get her package, but she had not been prepared for what the delivery contained. The investigation revealed that the fatal box delivered to Angela's house was filled with explosives, and the only man who Winston knew had any experience with such devices was Alvin.\n\nAlvin’s past in the military gave him the exposure and knowledge about explosives that most people didn't have. It was common knowledge in their tight-knit community where personal histories were difficult to conceal. While this knowledge alone didn’t constitute evidence, it was certainly one fact of many that were swirling around in Winston’s head.\n\nAs Alvin got up to leave, Winston gave him a tight smile, \"I hope you enjoy setting up your new coffin and your explosives display, Alvin,\" he said. “Thank you,” Alvin replied, oblivious to any undercurrent in the conversation, his calm demeanor never wavering. \n\nWinston finished his coffee, his mind firmly focused on the explosion that had taken Angela's life, the package that had been delivered, and questions that were begging to be answered.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

He rewound to the point where he noticed Lucy leave the fitness center. The time stamp showed 15 minutes after the coroner's estimated time of death of Tommy, the unfortunate victim.\n\nEarlier in the day, Winston had come across an interesting note in the primary investigations. Tommy had been receiving payments from Lucy, presumably to keep some secret that Lucy had unwittingly divulged. Tommy, however, had made known that it wasn't enough... that she needed to pay him a larger sum... a sum she wasn't able to produce.\n\nThis reality led Winston to pay some attention to Lucy. It turned out, Lucy, a known dancer, had an upcoming practice at the same fitness center on the fateful day of Tommy's demise. Lucy's dance was quite unique--she danced with a shiv, not just as a prop, but as an integral part of her performance, spinning, slashing, and twirling it around.\n\nWinston decided to visit the fitness center and found Lucy's signature in the sign-in sheet, marked at the same exact time as Tommy's estimated time of death. The receptionist chipped in, \"Lucy entered here with Tommy that day... this was actually the first time I'd seen them together.\" This suggested that Lucy had no choice but to confront Tommy in an attempt to stop his blackmailing.\n\nThe revelation about Lucy's professional life and her peculiar dance performances stunned him. The receptionist said, “If her secret was ever exposed, Lucy's career would end disastrously. As for her dance, her use of the shiv as part of her show is quite an expected sight.”\n\nMoreover, Winston discovered a faded, grubby envelope in Tommy’s gym locker. It was an anonymous letter, revealing Lucy's secret. Surprisingly, upon comparing Lucy’s signature from the sign-in sheet with the handwriting on the envelope, Winston realized Lucy herself had written the letter. Lucy, it seemed, had accidentally written the letter meant to be anonymous, revealing her secret to Tommy. This sparked a new theory in Winston's mind - Could this all be the result of a terrible mistake gone horribly wrong? Only time, and further inquiry, would reveal the truth.\n\nWinston had been at the precinct for hours, studying the late-night murder case, compartmentalizing the facts. He had a murder on his hands, the time of which coincided with the fitness center's evening rush hour. This was the very hour Jacqueline, a nimble and agile septuagenarian, stuck to her solitary routine, a time she never invited anyone to join. He was stringing together every strand of coincidence and building a plausible, provable scenario.\n\nTommy, the aspirational powerhouse of a man, had been on everyone's local lips lately. His audacious views had sparked controversy, but also an unexpected local following that was in the fitness center during evening hours. Yet at the height of his local fame, he had been brutally murdered with a shiv at the fitness center where he was renowned for hitting the weights hard, and importantly, where Jacqueline, the septuagenarian, kept to her solitary exercise routine.\n\nLooking at the evidence and timing, it was time for Winston to interview Jacqueline. Jacqueline's routine was predictable as the sunrise. Every evening, like clockwork, she'd rub shoulders with the gym-goers and the late-night Tommy fans; yet outside of the gym, she remained a loner, never inviting anyone to join her evening walks.\n\nAs he drove to the fitness center, he remembered how the quiet locals had reported hearing regular footsteps outside their homes late at night. This was presumably Jacqueline, a hardened septuagenarian known for her solo walks. The neighborhood itself was bustling with life, people making earnest attempts to stay fit, blowing off steam, or just flocking to see where local heartthrob Tommy worked out.\n\nHe found Jacqueline engrossed in her warm-up routine. The same lady that neighbors often spotted taking quiet, solo strolls when the rest of the neighborhood would be tucked in bed. \"I am Winston, ma'am. I believe you might have known Mr. Tommy?\"\n\nJacqueline pushed through her stretches, \"Oh, yes. That local loudmouth. We disagreed heavily on politics. I never missed an opportunity to oppose him publicly and even donated against his campaigns. But my walking? That's my own business, and I don't invite anyone on it.\"\n\nHer political rallies against Tommy were public knowledge, but Winston's eyes were drawn to a new piece of information - her feet. Jacqueline wore a pair of shoes that were strikingly similar to the specific footprint that attentive neighbors had reported. Winston made a mental note as their conversation continued.\n\n\"Well, ma'am, you've been very helpful in shedding light on those late-night footsteps the neighbors were worried about. Hopefully, they'd sleep more peacefully tonight, knowing they were from a friendly neighbor's shoe. If I have any more questions, I will certainly return.\"\n\nJacqueline's curt nod was all the acknowledgement Winston got as he bid her goodbye, her focus now entirely on her exercise session, which had kicked off for the day, the same time that aligned with Tommy's grim end.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Here he was at a vibrant chalet, which was recently the scene of a horrifying event. Evelyn, a well-known tarot reader in the town, and a frequent visitor at Malaysia's place for years, greeted him. Oddly, she was known to always bring Malaysia's spare set of chalet keys with her on each visit. \"Ah, Detective Winston, so good of you to finally join us,\" she noted with bitterness.\n\n\"I see you've made yourself at home, Evelyn,\" Winston nodded towards her open suitcases, purposely ignoring her remark.\n\n\"It's been transferred to my name after...after Malaysia's...\" Evelyn's lips trembled, the melancholy in her eyes genuine.\n\n\"Well, your card was drawn, I suppose.\" Winston hinted, \"Always wanted a chalet of your own?\"\n\nEvelyn returned his glance sharply, \"I won't deny that. But that doesn't mean I'd do anything drastic.\" Evelyn, a decades-old hunter initially drawn to the chalet's by the lure of game larger than even a human being, stated defensively. Her love for hunting and the thrill of pursuing such large game were known to all too well in town.\n\n\"Hmm. I'm surprised your extensive hunting experiences didn’t convince you to get one sooner. You've really been at it for years, haven't you?\"\n\nA small smile emerged on Evelyn's face, \"Ah, yes. Hunting is my...passion. Love the thrill of hunting animals of all sizes.\"\n\n\"I'm sure. The gun shop just down the street told me you recently bought a new rifle that peculiarly matches the description of the murder weapon,\" stated Winston, trying to mask suspicion from his tone.\n\nA flicker of surprise registered on Evelyn's face, \"Well, yes. I had just bought a new one recently. But...but...\"\n\nWinston took a mental note of her surprise, before standing, \"Thanks for your time, Evelyn. Your name on the gun shop records has been enlightening. I'll see myself out.\"\n\nEvelyn appeared taken aback, \"Oh...um...if you need anything else...you know where to find me.\" \n\nAs Winston sauntered back to his car, he recognized that his next task would be to double-check the gun shop's records and reclaim the security footage that links Evelyn’s purchasing transaction. He was on the brink of substantiating some valuable information.\n\nWinston toiled through the heat, questioning people, pulling at strings. The chalet incident was a head-scratcher– it wasn’t often that he saw such crimes, especially not with a rifle.\n\n\"Letti,\" he said moving to the window, \"you said you were home the night of the murder, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Letti answered, not meeting his eyes.\n\n\"But you confirmed you stayed at the chalet the night before the murder, and a staff member even recognized your car parked there overnight.\" There was no immediate response. His eyes darted back to the notes.\n\n“Minutes ago, I spoke to one of your friends who came here with you,\" he said, his gaze unwavering as he maintained eye contact with her. “She testified that you seemed unusually angered by Malaysia's new relationship.\"\n\n\"Can't see what that has to do with anything,\" Letti retorted, shrugging her shoulders.\n\nHe recalled a recent public event where Letti was a known presence. There had been controversy swirling around racist comments she had made – it had even made the local news. He brought it up, “And at that public event last month, you’ve made quite a spectacle with your racist comments.\"\n\nAnd then there was the incident at the chalet. He was getting word of it now, \"And what about the chaos you caused at the chalet just before Malaysia was killed? Your actions there were described as terrorist-like.\" Winston's brow furrowed. His mind spiraling further into the investigation.\n\nWhile he dealt with her in person, Winston thought back to the results of his earlier investigation, combing through Letti's open social media account. He found what he expected– consistent derogatory comments, racial slurs, and toxic language.\n\nHe looked back up from his screen. “During one of those parties, we caught you having a conversation with a known criminal. One of our officers overheard you two discussing illegal activities.\"\n\nIn conclusion, he pointed out one last damning piece of evidence. “Let’s not forget your frequent visits to a bar whose owner has been convicted for illegal alcohol trading.”\n\nA web of uncertainty was weaving itself, linking Letti to a nexus of unsavory activities. He knew he had to keep a closer eye on her, and hoped that she wouldn’t make any rash moves until he could piece it all together. Time was ticking away. He ended the conversation with no further comment from Letti, silently vowing to not let Malaysia’s death go unsolved.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Letti\nB.

The air was heavy with the scent of fresh coffee and the clamour of a bustling restaurant kitchen. His eyes fell on a seasoned chef, Rosemary, as she deftly wielded her bladed tools — knives, cleavers, graters — with calm precision. Watching her, it came as no surprise that Rosemary had clocked several years in this industry.\n\nSomething in the room changed. Shouting ensued, then a loud crash that rang out above the normal kitchen discord. Rosemary had hurled a metal pot across the room. The assistant, who stood close by, looked shocked but unharmed. Winston decided it was his cue to intervene.\n\n\"Rosemary, care to explain what just happened?\" Winston asked, stepping closer to the irate chef.\n\nShe gave him a guarded look before deliberately changing the subject, \"Did you know Timothy was a fan of my stir fry? Ironic, isn't it?\"\n\nWinston frowned slightly at the statement but decided to push forward. He knew how to dance around subjects, but Rosemary seemed skilled at the bucolic ballet of the restaurant business.\n\n\"I've heard some disturbing claims, Rosemary,\" Winston brought out his notebook, \"about the threats you've been issuing to Timothy, and your hostility towards people of his nationality.\"\n\nAt Winston's words, Rosemary ran a weary hand over her face and sighed. \"Seems word gets around.\"\n\n\"A public event, not long ago. You spoke openly about your, um-\" Winston glanced down at his notes, \"-'distaste' for Chinese folks,\" he pressed on, \"and you've been caught on tape making similar remarks towards Timothy.\"\n\n\"Is that a crime, detective?\" Rosemary challenged.\n\n\"I'm just here to piece the puzzle together. I understand you take a particular interest in Asian culture - antique Asian weapons in particular. I've seen your collection, Rosemary. Sais, even?\" he prodded, hoping for a reaction.\n\nRosemary's gaze sharpened as she turned her back on him, busily cleaning her array of kitchen knives. She didn't confirm nor deny his observation. Noting her silence, Winston thanked her for her time and walked out onto the casino floor, a maelstrom of thoughts whirling around his mind. He felt like he was leaving with more questions than when he had entered.\n\nWinston took a good look at the crime scene, a corner of the bustling casino, cordoned off by the police tape. Something felt grimly out of place among the bright lights and incessant chatter of the casino. He carefully sifted through the conflicting information and people's statements spinning in his head.\n\nTime to get some answers, Winston thought, and made his way to his interviewee.\n\nIt was late in the day when he finally knocked on Harry's door. A man in his early thirties, with a life-hardened face glanced out at him skeptically.\n\n\"Harry, correct?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"And who's asking?\" came the guarded reply.\n\n\"Detective Winston,\" he flashed his badge, \"I'm here to ask you a few questions about Timothy.\"\n\nHarry's eyes flashed, \"I'm not surprised,\" he grumbled. \"Come on in then.\"\n\nAs Winston made his way inside, he noticed the place bore a striking resemblance to traditional dojo settings. A pair of sai swords caught his eye, arranged carefully on a display holder. A typical weapon of the martial arts form Harry used to instruct.\n\n\"Nice collection.\" Winston gestured towards the sai. \"You instruct?\"\n\nHarry looked back at the sai, \"Used to.\"\n\nHarry's manner was gruff, but he seemed at home sharing his old days as a martial arts instructor. They talked about martial arts, how Harry won several competitions, his daily training routine, which apparently included practicing with the sai regularly. Harry's days as a horse trainer surfaced later in the conversation.\n\n\"Got dealt a bad hand?\" Winston inquired casually, nodding at the pile of losing horse race betting slips on Harry's coffee table. \n\nHarry grunted, \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWinston knew Harry only had income from betting on races, and recently he had lost quite a few. Harry had a deep gambling debt with Timothy over his betting habits. Photography was not Winston's hobby, but he recalled Harry's face distinctly in the casino cameras' footage from before the murder took place. There were rumors that Timothy was planning to expose Harry's debt to the other horse owners, and the situation got tough.\n\n\"Got into any recent arguments?\" Winston asked.\n\nHarry frowned and averted his eyes, \"Maybe...just one with Timothy at the casino.”\n\nWinston nodded, keeping his expression neutral. The timing was unfortunate, he thought. And that debt wasn't going anywhere, especially with Harry having recently lost his job at the stables.\n\n\"Heard you were giving out loans?' Winston asked.\n\nHarry's face stiffened, \"He needed money\", he replied, explaining that Timothy had lent him a large sum of money specifically for his betting habit, a haunted expression crossing his face.\n\nWinston stood up, concluding his visit, \"Just one last thing, Harry,\" Winston queried, \"The VIP lounge, in the casino? You're familiar with it, aren't you?\"\n\nHarry met Winston's gaze, resignation in his eyes, \"Used to spend a lot of time there.\"\n\nAs Winston exited the apartment, he couldn't shake off the heavy feeling hanging in the air, leaving him with more questions than answers. Good thing he was in a questioning mood.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Harry\nB.

The sight of Cecilia's body, found long after the time Stuart was noted alone at the site lent a sense of unease that still imprinted in his mind from the crime scene photos.\n\nThere was a strange quiet that persisted in the area as the evening shadows coalesced further into night. Winston was particularly interested in the electrical works of the chalet, the severed power cables indicative of Stuart’s well-known method of using his axe to cut them. All conveniently hidden behind walls and ceilings but paramount in their purpose. He was reminded that important clues sometimes lurk in the most innocuous of places.\n\nWinston glanced around, his gaze settling on Stuart lumbering towards him. As usual, the man had his tool bag over one sturdy shoulder, the familiar shape of an axe imprinted onto its side. Its weight was seemingly imprinted onto Stuart’s posture, yet worn with a sense of profound solidarity. A sense of familiarity, born from years of dedication to his profession and the meticulous demand for his specialized tools, such as axes.\n\n“Stuart?” Winston enquired, attempting to mirror a casual air.\n\n“Yeah, that would be me,” Stuart responded, his respect for the detective's powerful presence evident.\n\n“You've been working on this property?”\n\n“Sure have,” the large man nodded, setting his tool bag into the dirt nearby. The soft clink of tools echoed faintly in the silent expanse. Stuart was a proficient electrician, everyone in the county knew. He had harbored resentment against Cecilia, for reasons unknown; a motive that lingered with a subtle hint in the air. His rigor and loyalty to his profession manifested in every job site he touched—an axe always included in his equipment.\n\nA long moment passed, the evening wind whistling in the background. \n\n\"Cecilia, the owner... she hired you, didn't she?\" Winston broke the silence, his gaze firm on Stuart.\n\n“Yeah... had a bad power outage that day.\"\n\n\"How long did it last?\"\n\n\"Unusual one. Lasted all day actually.\"\n\nThe chirping of crickets began to build and a layer of frost was slowly painting itself across the chalet’s exterior. This suggested that there were no other workers or inhabitants during the time of Stuart's work.\n\nWinston found himself hooked onto the echo of Stuart's resounding words, stirring question after question in his mind. He wouldn’t voice them; not yet. \n\nA cold wind blew past the duo, shifting leaves rustled around the chalet whispering secrets that they had witnessed. A secret Winston had set out to uncover. With that, he bid Stuart a goodnight and left the chalet site, the outline of the crime scene etched into his memory as he sped off into the distance; his wearied sights set on tomorrow's set of questions.\n\nDetective Winston sat in his office, a thick folder splayed open in front of him. Inside were various reports about a school counselor named Alice. Alice was evidently no ordinary school counselor - a slew of allegations and complications surrounded her. \n\nWinston got up, tucked the folder under his arm and headed to the school where Alice was employed.\n\nAs he approached the counselor's office, he could hear the muffled sound of murmuring in the hallway around him. Alice was known for her involvement in outdoor activities for students – particularly annual camping trips. Winston glimpsed several pictures of these camping trips on a notice board outside the office, seeing Alice in several of them, even demonstrating axe-use to the students.\n\nHe knocked gently before letting himself into Alice’s office. \n\n“Ms. Alice, I presume?” He asked, to which she nodded. \n\nThere was an air of tension about her. Perhaps it was because she was carrying the burden of an extramarital affair that threatened her standing in the local community and her professional career. It was common knowledge in the school corridors that Alice was on the brink of losing her job due to the scandal. \n\nThe conversation turned to Alice's personal life, Winston asked, \"Ms. Alice, it seems you have a fair amount of free time in the evenings?\" Alice agreed, mentioning that she spent her evenings alone in a particular room at her house. Her neighbors had reportedly seen her carrying stacks of newspapers into her house, which she hardly ever let anyone in. They claimed to have heard her reading out loud from these newspapers, specifically obituaries, although Winston kept this bit to himself.\n\nThe mention of the school's woodshop arose during the conversation, with the principal having reported seeing Alice take an axe from there post-school hours. Alice explained it was a tool demonstration for the camping trips, but Winston noted down the fact, considering the murderer’s weapon – an axe. \n\nMention of Cecilia came up, the young girl who had lost her life in a chalet not long ago. Alice didn't seem surprised at the mention of Cecilia, nodding and mentioning about her being one of her students. \n\nA little bird had earlier mentioned that Cecilia had tripped over Alice’s secret of a grade-changing scandal and had evidence of her infamous extramarital affair. \n\nAs Winston left Alice’s office, he knew the web was much more tangled than what met the eye.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Travis, found dead, his face cleaved into an unfamiliar version of the joy-filled man he was known to be.\n\nThere was a suspect that piqued Winston's interest, Bryan. Known all around town for his cookery, especially for his handy use of a hatchet while chopping the hardest of ingredients, sharpened meticulously before each use. Bryan could frequently be seen by town residents, unloading boxes from his delivery truck into his city home, often containing specialized cooking equipment that he personally ordered for home delivery. Further, several witnesses had seen him unloading an array of boxes from his truck into this secluded cabin. Winston learned that Bryan had an insatiable thirst for ensuring his kitchen was bursting with the latest culinary tools. \n\n\"Bryan, what were you doing driving up to this lonely cabin the other day? Delivering more of your tools?\" Winston asked him, taking a seat across from Bryan.\n\n\"Well, detective, I was just bringin' up some of my cookin' tools. I've been doin' a lot of grilling up here recently,\" Bryan stuttered, his eyes nervously darted.\n\n\"Hatchets for food preparation, huh? That sure is an interesting hobby, Bryan.\" Winston mentioned. He recalled seeing Bryan the previous day, honing the edge of his hatchet with precision.\n\n\"Yes, sir. It's been tradition since when I was a teen. I used to participate lots in hatchet throwin' competitions, you see,\" Bryan said, his eyes now safely back on Winston, the color slowly draining as he spoke.\n\nInteresting, Winston thought. \"Tell me, Bryan. Were Travis's pranks bothering you? Those about you dipping into the petty cash?\"\n\nBryan hesitated for a moment, weighing his words. \"About all of his mockery... it's been tough,\" Bryan said, avoiding Winston's gaze.  \"He's been parading around, telling everyone that I've been stealing. He even found a way to publicize I've been dipping into our petty cash.\"\n\nWinston nodded, trying not to show his surprise. Travis, that jolly, carefree soul resorting to humiliation and accusations? Hard to believe.\n\n\"Seems like you've been quite worried about jail, huh, Bryan? Aren't you scared of these accusations?\"\n\n\"Y-yes... I... I can't go to jail, detective. That’s my worst nightmare, I ...\" Bryan faltered, his hand instinctively brushing over his jeans where Winston could spot the handle of his sharpened hatchet, just peeking out, its shine all too prominent.\n\nWinston settled in at his desk, running his fingers over the cold, metallic edges of the woodworking tools that lay strewn across his workspace. They were in evidence bags, cataloged meticulously. A particular hatchet caught his eye, one that lab results had confirmed as the murder weapon. It belonged to Everett, who managed his own private collection of woodworking tools.\n\nEverett, a curator with a keen interest in woodworking, worked at a museum dedicated to the craft. His tools, his museum job, the woodworking... along with these, evidence bags with Everett's paragliding equipment caught Winston's eye. They were marked as found at the murder site, logged and stored.\n\nDeviating from his thoughts about woodworking, Winston began browsing through the case profiles scrolling across his screen.\n\nTravis, the victim, was a paragliding aficionado who had recently earned an international award within the sport—a revered distinction that Everett had also vied for failing to clinch. It seemed Everett struggled for the same acclaim, without much luck. \n\nEverett's paragliding equipment, now part of the collected evidence from the murder site, was a strong indictor. This was where Travis had met his end. Coincidently the same place where a paragliding event was held that day. \n\nStraightening up and pocketing his notebook, Winston decided to pay a visit to Everett at the museum.\n\nWhilst there, he noticed Everett skilfully fashioning a piece of wood into a bird’s wing. Maybe it was the context, but it struck him the resemblance it bore to a paraglider's wing.\n\n“Detective Winston,” Everett greeted him, offering a firm, rugged handshake. “Care for a tour?”\n\nWinston declined the offer. “I hear you and Travis were at the same paragliding meetup that day,” Winston started with a nonchalant shrug of his shoulders.\n\nEverett, with a somber nod, confirmed his attendance at said meetup. He muttered something about always being in Travis’ shadow, causing Winston to raise his brow in intrigue.\n\nBefore leaving the museum, he waved down a few visitors, asking if they also shared an interest in paragliding. To his surprise, all of them recalled seeing Everett’s vehicle parked at the site of the meetup that day, matching the timings of the murder deeds.\n\nWith the image of the hatchet from Everett's collection - the very one identified as the murder weapon - Everett's paragliding gear found at the crime scene, and the chilling timeline coming together, Winston stepped back into the early evening humidity, a new sense of the suspect's world giving weight to his thoughts. But, those dots could wait for another day to connect. For now, it was time to head back to the precinct.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Bryan\nB.

He allowed the scene to imprint itself in his mind before he would venture inside to inspect the crime scene. A murder at the movies was a rarity. But what was even more unusual was the murder weapon used: a meat cleaver.\n\nReviewing the details of the case once more, Winston thought about some key players involved. Undeniably traceable was Gloria, a hardcore fan of the rock band 'The Butchers', known by everyone and even herself in interviews, as a groupie. She had also confessed in one such media interaction that she was crazy about taxidermy, a hobby brought to life in her house.\n\nLeaving the crime scene, Winston made his way to Gloria's house in the fading evening sun. Upon entering Gloria's home, he found himself in a museum of morbid curiosity. From the ceiling to the floor, taxidermied animals filled the house with glassy eyes reflecting in the dim light, a testimony to her hobby.\n\nAmong her collection, he noticed a recent addition - a rare bird, its exotic colors momentarily catching his gaze. Bob, the local bird dealer, had already confirmed its purchase by Gloria.\n\nWinston inquired about her whereabouts the previous night.\n\n\"Well, I was at the movie premiere, of course,\" Gloria responded. \"I, along with Tracy, went to the double event. The Butchers premiered their new music video during the movie. And well, you couldn't expect me to miss that, now could you? I follow every event they put up and not just because I'm a fan. Because I am in love with the lead singer, and yes I'm saying it.\"\n\nWinston let the information sink in.\n\n\"Well... isn't it true that Tracy, the victim, was planning to go public with an affair?\" Winston asked.\n\nA momentary flicker passed in Gloria's eyes. \"Yes... I know about that,\" Gloria confessed. \"She was dating the lead singer, the poor man. She wanted to reveal everything, destroy everything.\"\n\nWith that, Winston left Gloria's house with more questions buzzing in his head. He got back into his car, piecing together the intricate web of clues this case held. The concert that the Butchers were supposed to play after the movie was now going to be remembered for all the wrong reasons.\n\nDeep in thought, Winston flipped through the photographs of the movie theatre crime scene, when his partner handed him an envelope. A DVD from the theatre's CCTV records, witnessing every unscripted moment at the theatre that did double-duty, not just as a place to showcase films, but also as a distinctive setting for unorthodox weddings, just like the one Tracy had intended to have. Eyewitnesses at the scene confirmed Nicole's presence at the theatre during the murder. The records would be viewed later.\n\nHis current priority was to interrogate Nicole, the esteemed wedding planner, the woman whose entire reputation and business were built on her success in this field. By an unfortunate coincidence, she had been at the theatre when Tracy was murdered, not just as a cinema enthusiast, but as the individual orchestrating Tracy's movie-themed wedding at the same theatre.\n\n\"Nice place you've got here,\" Winston observed as he ventured into Nicole's office, its grandeur coupled with an array of movie posters illustrating her success in planning film-themed weddings.\n\n\"Well, Detective, events won't plan themselves,\" Nicole said, with a small, tight smile. \"Tracy hired me for one of my elaborate movie-themed weddings. She was drawn to the unusual.\"\n\nSurveying the space, he noticed it was not only amassed with wedding supplies but also held a vast array of kitchen equipment. Nicole had been responsible for preparing the meat at several events as evident from the professional cleavers that took center stage amongst the kitchenware. One of them catching his eye; a meat cleaver.\n\n\"On food responsibility as well?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"Indeed. Delivering comprehensive experiences is the goal. Every specification matters, including the banquet,\" Nicole imparted. \"My past as a culinary student till being a wedding planner helped shape that. I even received professional training in meat preparation.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston murmured, quickly connecting two points - Nicole's past culinary training and Tracy's murder weapon, a meat cleaver.\n\n\"Rumor has it that you made a considerable blunder at Tracy's wedding,\" Winston broached. \"Word on the street is that Tracy was so embarrassed she was looking to file a malpractice suit against you.”\n\n\"A minor miscalculation. No one is perfect, detective. However, Tracy blew it out of proportion,\" Nicole responded, her face growing somber.\n\nObserving her seemingly unflustered demeanor, Winston mused on her case. He knew a large scale malpractice suit could irreparably harm a professional's reputation. For someone like Nicole whose entire business relied on her successful track record as a wedding planner, it could be a fateful blow. \n\nBefore confronting her head-on, he decided to examine the perspectives of the eyewitnesses and the CCTV footage. His eyes strayed to the cold, gleaming steel of the meat cleaver amidst Nicole's kitchen equipment. This reminded him of Tracy, and he made himself a promise: he would find justice for her.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Nicole\nB.

The murder of Howard wasn't a simple case. Howard, a workaholic, often spent late hours alone in his home office. This detail was well-known among the local community, and was confirmed by his visibly lit office window at night. Night after night, the sensor lights in Priscilla's driveway snapped on. The neighbor's dog howling in protest was a nightly routine in that silent suburb. The city records had also confirmed there was no power outage to explain this.\n\nWinston spent his evening in his car, watching Priscilla's house fade into the twilight. Exactly at 11:00 PM, the lights went out. The city was at rest, but not him.\n\nThe following morning, he reached Howard's property. The land was notably fenced with barbed wire. The house felt eerily quiet for a place that was buzzing till late every night, a direct contradiction to Howard's usual late-night work routine in his office. Detective Winston crossed the threshold of the house, standing in the middle of the late man's office.\n\nA neighbor from across the street approached him warily. Fear and curiosity in her dark eyes, she shared how she had occasionally seen Priscilla's car parked outside Howard's house. She specifically mentioned a time that coincided with the time of murder, which made Priscilla an even more interesting person of interest.\n\nLater on, Winston paid a visit to Priscilla. She was a lean woman with sharp eyes, an indication of her military background. To his surprise, she had no alibi for the time of Howard's murder. Her familiarity with the layout of Howard's house was apparent as she effortlessly guided Winston through the house, talking about her frequent visits to this place.\n\nWinston noted down her tidbits, like how she used to be involved in some criminal activities involving barbed wire. He, however, made no comment. She justified it by her time in the military, stating it was an easily accessible and efficient material back then.\n\nBack at his office, Winston couldn't shake off an uneasy feeling. The constant motion-sensor light flicker, the familiarity with the house, the absence of an alibi, and neighbor's observation of her car at the crime scene... they were just pieces of a big puzzle waiting to be solved. \n\n\"Hey Winston,\" a fellow officer dropped by his desk, \"got yourself a late-night mystery.\"\n\nBut Winston just sipped his now cold cup of coffee in response. It was a long, long night ahead.\n\nWinston exhaled a slow stream of smoke from his cigarette, staring down at the case file in front of him. Howard, dead in his own home office, secluded away in a secret crescendo of the house, known only to one person - Eric. \n\nEric, a local pet groomer and the last known visitor at Howard's house, was the only one seen in the vicinity that day as confirmed by street surveillance. Winston rang the doorbell of the Pet Grooming Station, and soon a youthful man in a set of coveralls answered, his hands marked up with a variety of small scratches.\n\n\"You Eric?\" Winston asked, flashing his badge.\n\n\"That's me,\" Eric acknowledged, offering a friendly nod.\n\n\"I understand you're the regular pet groomer for Howard?\" Winston inquired.\n\n\"I am, sir,” Eric responded cordially, “I was just over at his house earlier today, grooming his pets. His office was the cleanest room; Howard always took pride in it.\"\n\nWinston hummed and checked off something on his notepad. Eric, worn out, decided to sit down and pulled a diary from his pocket. Flipping through the pages, Eric showed a particular entry. It was a confession of his love for a woman named Gloria, \"I've always loved this girl named Gloria. She shows me signs of affection, but she's engaged to Howard,\" Eric read out loud.\n\n“You carry your work tools with you, right?” asked Winston, a note of suspicion entering his voice.\n\n\"Yes,” Eric replied, a flicker of surprise crossing his features, “I like to be prepared. I even carry fencing materials like barbed wire for temporary partitions when grooming pets.\"\n\nWinston let a slow smile spread across his face. \"It so happens the place where Howard was found dead was wrapped in barbed wire, with traces of pet fur on it.\"\n\n\"A horrible coincidence indeed,\" Eric responded, warily.\n\nWinston gave a nod, buttoning up his coat. “Thank you for your time, Eric.”\n\n“Anything for the law, Detective,” Eric said, lingering at the door until Winston drove out of sight.\n\n“So here’s a twist for you,” Winston muttered to himself, checking off another item on his case notes and wondering about the potential romantic triangle. From the background noise of screeching pets at Eric's establishment, he drove back to Howard's crime scene, ready to sift through the evidence once again.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The murder that occurred in a local synagogue, and the victim's name, Vanessa, stirred up an old memory. After what he had seen, quitting had often filled his thoughts. But solving cases like these held an irreplaceable allure to Winston’s trouble-stricken mind.\n\nHis first lead came in the form of an irregular character by the name Clarence. A truck driver who works long hours, regularly present near the synagogue amongst other stops, and oddly enough, an ardent collector of obituaries. Often, community members would speak in hushed tones of Clarence’s nightly tears shed over obituaries, forming an image of emotional investment over people he had no known connection with. Despite their gossiping, none of them had ever heard of Clarence befriending or nurturing a relationship with anyone mentioned in the obituaries. In fact, during their investigation, the police found no documented ties of Clara with the deceased individuals, either.\n\nOver black coffee and stale bread in a nearby diner, Detective Winston conversed with Clarence. \"So you’re a truck driver? Tough gig, I imagine,\" Winston started the conversation the way he always did, meandering towards his point while observing reactions.\n\n\"You bet. I've been doing this job for a while now, driving all sorts of routes. Comes with its own set of challenges, like finding a decent mechanic on the go. I had to learn repairing my truck on my own. Hence, the toolbox you see me lugging around,\" Clarence responded.\n\nDetective Winston veered the discussion towards Vanessa, \"And what brings you around the synagogue frequently?\"\n\n\"Well, work mostly. But it’s no secret - Vanessa, she and me... We used to be together. She'd often be at the synagogue. Despite how things ended with us, my old habits never really changed,\" Clarence replied with a forlorn sigh.\n\nAs Winston remembered Vanessa's face and Clarence's haggard expression, sleep felt like a distant luxury. Skimming through the raw facts in his notebook, this was no game of conjectures, the hard evidence was yet to fit in the puzzle. And with that last thought, he closed the notebook shut for the night.\n\nDetective Winston stood, perched in the corner of the local hardware store. He watched from behind a pyramid of paint cans, peering at Ivy as she demonstrated a new set of screwdrivers to a customer. Overalls clad, she seemed like an everyday, hard-working woman. She completed the sale and moved on to help the next customer, carrying another set of similar tools to the customer who was looking for a specific size. It was clear that she moved deftly and knew her products well. \n\nIt troubled Winston how an ordinary day selling hardware could be turned on its head so rapidly, by a single piece of information. Winston decided to make his move. He stepped out from his hiding place, adjusting the collar of his trench coat to protect from the sudden gust of wind that swept through the open door.\n\n“Hello, Ivy,” he said, his gaze piercing through her.\n\nDropping her head down, the terror and desperation in Ivy’s eyes were evident. Caught in a blackmail situation over deep secrets that Vanessa had threatened to reveal, secrets that could ruin her reputation, it was serving harsh punishments on her livelihood in the form of lost customers. She feared her secrets would come out any day now. It was this fear that had greeted Winston when Ivy arrived at the synagogue that morning, noticeably before Vanessa's life was tragically ended there.\n\nRefusing to meet his gaze, she nodded, inviting him to continue.   \"We belong to the same community,\" Winston said nonchalantly. \"How about those services at the synagogue? You usually attend weekly, right? Speaking of, I couldn't help but notice you were the first to arrive on the fateful morning Vanessa was killed.\" \n\n“Ye-yes,” Ivy stuttered, caught off guard. \n\n\"Wonderful sermons,\" Winston went on, \"I heard about the incident at the synagogue, terrible loss for us all. Vanessa was such a wonderful woman.\"\n\nA tightening grip around her own worn hands was the only sign from Ivy that she felt the weight and severity of the situation, she offered a low, mournful \"Yes,\" in agreement.\n\nThe gloom was creeping in, matching the evident fear, and Winston fiddled with the notepad in his hands. He had one more stop to make before he was done for the day. \n\n\"I'll be seeing you around, Ivy,\" he left her to tend to her work still reeling from the effects of the ongoing blackmail. It was a bit troubling news for a woman who seemed to be losing her livelihood amidst the desperation and fear that she was immersed in. \n\nWinston left the store, the falling sun casting long shadows. Ivy’s secrets were her own, whatever they were. It was something he knew Vanessa had threatened to reveal, which now loom over her existence. There was a chill in the air, much like the uncertainty that hung over the case.\n\nIvy stood there, amidst rows and shelves of tools and hardware equipment she sold daily, in a store that had been affected by the blackmail. Despite demonstrating tools like screwdrivers all day, every day, she was no murderer, and Winston knew that the truth would ultimately reveal itself.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

It projected grainy CCTV footage of his suspect - Marianne. She was there at the roller rink, on the night poor Wendy met her end. Not only was Marianne there - she was seen shouting at Wendy, their voices escalating until they pierced the rhythmic hum of the skating wheels. The timestamp of the argument, and subsequent footage of Marianne lingering, suggested she was there for quite some time after her dispute with Wendy.\n\nHe thumbed through a thin folder tucked beneath a closing pizza box resting on his cluttered desk. Marianne had a criminal record, it revealed a past fraught with moments of explosion, of violence - including an assault arrest five years prior. The Marianne on the screen, the Marianne in these documents had been caught in the wrong before. Winston began to feel a creeping uneasiness as he parsed this correlation. \n\nSeveral pictures tumbled from the folder as Winston shuffled its contents. The pictures were snapshots of Marianne: caught in the midst of her day-to-day, widely recognized by the community - not just for her nature but for her frequent use of an old pickaxe. It came as no surprise since she had spent several years working in the mines before her marriage. She was seen using her pickaxe for numerous tasks such as chopping firewood or loosening soil in her garden. \n\n\"Did you see what she was doing last week?\" a seasoned woman down the road had mentioned as she was reversing her car out of the driveway. Marianne was seen cleaning her well-worn mining equipment that she'd kept stored in an easily accessible tool-shed next to her house in clear sight. It seemed she wasn't shy about flaunting her past or the tools she used while in the mines.\n\nCommotion at the precinct broke Winston from his thoughts. The crime-scene analyst reported the murder took place in some remote corner of the roller rink. Despite the public dispute that took place earlier between Wendy and Marianne, this location seemed isolated, uncanny for such a busy locale.\n\nThe analyst's words seemed to chisel further into Winston's thoughts as he returned to the grainy images. Her mining equipment was never far from reach, and Marian's cacophony on the night of Wendy's murder was caught on tape. \n\nPieces started falling into place; too many strings tethered Marianne to the night Wendy was murdered. With a sigh, Winston allowed himself a quiet moment. Then, taking a deep breath, he began his descent into the intricacies of the case before him.\n\nWinston stood at the entrance of the roller rink, eyes scanning the room. The images from the forensics timeline replayed in his memory. Poor Wendy was murdered between 7 to 9 pm, coinciding perfectly with the time Sidney usually spent at the rink. The roller rink, a place that normally buzzed with the rejuvenating sounds of retro music and flashing lights, had become her death place.\n\nSidney, who was a geologist, had been seen with Wendy at the roller rink multiple times. According to the staff, Sidney was even a regular here. It was a curious detail but not unusual, people had hobbies apart from their professions.\n\nChecking his notes from the previous conversation with Sidney, his eyebrows knitted slightly at the desperation he had sensed from Sidney. It revolved around Wendy, who apparently knew something he coveted as a secret. She apparently had been sharing this secret with her friends, and it seemed it held the power to publicly humiliate Sidney if it ever came to light. Sidney, for his part, vehemently denied any secret of such scale.\n\nWinston gestured for the barista to come over. The young man with a skater haircut glanced at Winston's badge before he ordered a black coffee with no sugar. While waiting for his order, he asked, “Did you notice Sidney here during the time of the incident?”\n\nThe barista nodded, nervously biting his lower lip. \"Yes, Detective. Sidney was here. I remember seeing him from 7 to 9 pm, during the time that Wendy was murdered.\"\n\nWinston nodded as he continued his observations. His gaze lingered over Sidney's station where he parked his geologist equipment when he visited. He noticed the stains of regular wear and tear and a freshly cleaned pickaxe leaning against the wall. Nothing unusual for a geologist. Taking down notes, Winston silently queued the information; that very pickaxe might have been used for the murder.\n\nHis phone buzzed breaking his trail of thoughts, He took the informer's call. He glanced at his watch, noting down the time of the conversation before disconnecting the call. He finished his coffee and left the roller rink. He had to confirm if Wendy was indeed telling the truth about that secret or Sidney was just an innocent geologist who loved rollerblading and hated gossip.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

He spotted his suspect, Lucy, practicing one of her dance routines in the corner, just finishing another session of her hauntingly dark paintings.\n\n“Ma’am?” Winston lifted his badge out for Lucy to see.\n\nShe took a break from her routine to meet him, panting slightly. “You looking for Lucy?”\n\n“I am,” Winston replied stoically.\n\nLucy chuckled lightly, tucking one hair strand behind her ear. She used her other hand to point towards a door. “I’ll clean up as I usually do after my painting sessions. I'll wash off the red paint from my hands and then we can sit down, alright?” She motioned to her red-stained hands.\n\nWinston nodded to the suspect, observing her depart towards the sinks at the corner of the room. “Take your time, ma’am.”\n\nLucy returned a few moments later, now sporting clean hands. They sat down in a nearby seating area. A few stray paintbrushes and a vibrant pallet of red, visible even from afar, seemed to bring her comfort.\n\n\"Do you paint?\" Winston asked.\n\nShe picked up a paintbrush. “Yes, I love it. It's therapeutic. In every stroke, I express my emotions. That's why my art sometimes gets a bit... dark.\" Red is my favorite color. And I like to dance.”\n\nShe lifted up a shiv she kept alongside her, remarking, \"I use this in my dance performances too. It becomes a part of me.\" \n\nLater, Winston produced the anonymous letter sent to Tommy. \"Have you seen this? Tommy claims to have received it.\"\n\nLucy looked away, avoiding his gaze. \"I didn't mean for Tommy to get that letter. It was a mistake.\"\n\nShe then confessed, \"The truth is...Tommy's been blackmailing me. He said he might let things slide if I gave him a huge sum of money, more than I could afford. I was going to reveal my secret but... that letter wasn't meant for Tommy.\" Lucy's face was filled with regret. \"I didn't have any other way to stop him. I didn't know what to do... I even tried to give a large payment, but it wasn't enough for him.\"\n\nShe choked back tears, confessing softly, \"My career... it would be over if my secret got out.\"\n\nWinston watched her closely as she fought back tears, her hands clenched tightly around her paintbrush and shiv. Winston thanked Lucy for her time, promising to look into her claims.\n\nAs Winston left the fitness center he stopped to take a look at Lucy's paintings displayed on the walls. They were chilling images of detached body parts, made more unnerving by Lucy's enthusiastic use of the color red.\n\nHe glanced back, Lucy had resumed dancing, the shiv playing a critical part in her performance. Winston took one last look then made his way out the door, leaving Lucy alone to dance.\n\nWinston considered the crime scene: a fitness center. An unlikely place for Tommy to meet his end - on a treadmill no less. Tommy was certainly physically fit, and recently had become quite popular among locals due to his polarizing political views. He was often the subject of public discourse, none more vocal than Jacqueline in her opposition to his ideas.\n\nThe forensic team gave him the breakdown, a shiv. Winston could only sigh at the gruesomeness of it all. NHS workers giving it their best shot trying to return the room to its former glory. However, whoever was responsible was not the type to make petty mistakes.\n\nJacqueline was next on his visit list. A regular protester at Tommy's rallies, her public denouncements of his political stances were well known. And since the murder had occurred during her workout, it would make sense to hear from her.\n\nJacqueline - a nicely aged woman, apparently physically fit and capable – was a regular at the gym. She trained there every day without fail. That day she was pulling off a routine on a rowing machine with a synchronicity one could compare to a clock tick. \n\n\"Do you remember seeing or hearing anything unusual?\" Winston asked.\n\nJacqueline halted her rowing, turning to Winston with a crisp look in her eyes. \"No, detective,\" she said, dabbing a sweat towel on her forehead. \"In fact, it was ironically business as usual.\"\n\nBusiness as usual. In a way, Winston thought, it was. Tommy was known for riling up others, though nothing harmful ever really seemed to come of it. Until now. \n\nThe talk around town was that Jacqueline had served time for 15 years nearly two decades ago. Interestingly, she'd also studied various forms of self-defense while in prison, and since her release, she had made herself a bastion of physical and mental fortitude.\n\n\"People don't change, detective,\" Jacqueline stated, seemingly reading his mind. \"When I was younger I made some bad choices. I've paid for them. We all have a past and mine happens to be a bit darker than others.\"\n\n\"And Tommy,\" Jacqueline paused, searching Winston's face, \"He was just like me, just on the other side of the fence. Got too comfortable and careless, people like Tommy have a way of doing that.\"\n\n\"All I can say is lots of people contribute to anti-Tommy campaigns, and I have my own ideas. It's free speech, right?\" With unwavering determination, Jacqueline continued her pointed assertions against Tommy, echoing her public remarks. She went back to her rowing routine without missing a beat, her eyes now fixed on the TV that was flashing Tommy's controversial speeches on a news channel.\n\nWinston thought for a moment before making his exit. He came across Jacqueline plenty of times, she was a regular - like an everyday murmur with a well-timed routine. Winston left with more questions than answers.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Lucy\nB.

Winston stood by a knife vendor, studying the surroundings and the tiny details on the numerous steel blades that the stall offered, a permanent fixture amidst the bustling metropolis. The merchandise varied from small purpose knives to larger hunting blades - the very kind the murderer had used on Ana under a dimly lit Times Square in the cool of the evening.\n\n\"Crowded, ain't it?\" The voice from behind the stand cut through the noise. Cecilia, the vendor, looking comfortably settled amidst her deadly contraband.\n\n\"Yes, it's surprising that a murder could have even been committed here amidst all these people, especially during the bustle of the evening hours.\" Winston replied nonchalantly.\n\n\"Ah, yes, poor Ana,\" Cecilia responded, keeping her eyes busy on the sturdy hunting knife she uses daily at her stand, continuing to work. \"She gave me an odd feeling, always around here... snapping pictures of my stand, asking about legal implications for vendors and all.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Winston raised an eyebrow. \"Did you two interact much?\"\n\n\"Can't say we did... She did ask questions about the legality of such sales and other specific vendor-related requirements. Seemed keen on the legality of such sales, she was. 'course, everything's above board here,\" Cecilia stated, raising a knife to the evening sky, inspecting it for any unseen flaws before putting it down with her other blades for sale.\n\nWith the swiftness of someone who had used knives for years, Cecilia felt at ease with these tools of destruction. The hunting knife she held now was her personal favorite; it was what she used daily. She had even taken classes to master it. \n\n\"I'm set up here all day, every day,\" Cecilia explained, seeing Winston's gaze darting over her stand. \"Evening tends to attract more customers, people coming off work, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Ana seemed a bit too interested in my stall,\" Cecilia added after a pause and glanced at Winston. \"Found an anonymous tip against me on her phone. Not very sporting, I'd say.\"\n\nJust another day in the city, Winston thought as he finished up his tour of the vendor’s stand, a tiny permanent colony amidst the swirling chaos of Time Square.\n\nDetective Winston pulled out his notebook, sitting alone in his sedan. He scanned his notes about the deceased woman, Ana, a case of rampant aggression in the heart of Times Square that simply astounded him.\n\nA notable red flag kept popping up amongst his notes: Marjorie, an experienced live-in nanny for the Johnson family, who were known to frequent Times Square — owing primarily to Marjorie's routine of taking the children to the bustling location. Her odd choice of a hunting knife for a fruit cutter - something she'd often use to cut fruit for the Johnson kids, was unique, but not particularly unsettling until matched with its recent absence from the Johnson household. Additionally, there was a piece of evidence that traced Marjorie to a local store which sold the same type of hunting knife, on the day of the murder, thus adding to Winston's growing interest in her. \n\nWinston found himself curious about all this, a smokescreen that might be hiding something. Thumbing a few pages back, Winston retraced the parents' description of Marjorie as obsessively clean, always tidying in the Johnson home. According to the parents, the house was always spotless and the nanny never seemed to part with her usual duster. \n\nAs he reached the last few lines, he recollected an interesting observation – an eyewitness placed Marjorie in the vicinity of Times Square at the approximate hour Ana had been murdered. With his quick note-taking, he jotted down another unexpected detail shared by a separate witness – the Johnson boys had been seen at that same hour in Times Square without their usual, vigilant nanny. Noting down a quick reminder to follow up with the parents, Winston lowered his notebook. The Huntsman knife, a tool she'd deftly used for slicing fruit for the children and now missing from its usual spot in the kitchen of the Johnson home, placed Marjorie high on his list of persons of interest. \n\nAdditional evidence he mused over was a recollection from Marjorie's employer, who mentioned seeing her sharpen the knife's edge the very morning of the murder. This image was not incriminating on its own, but when coupled with the fact Marjorie always seemed armed with cleaning supplies, questions arose. How far would someone go to hide dirty secrets under the guise of cleanliness?\n\nWinston sighed, running a hand over his worn notebook. Parents praised Marjorie for the impeccable cleanliness of the living room, which, Winston recalled, was spotless to the point of suspicion. Even when the room looked clean, Marjorie would spend seemingly excessive time maintaining the pristine condition.\n\nFinally closing the worn leather notebook, Winston glanced at his wristwatch, updating himself with the fact that Marjorie was recorded leaving the Johnson estate around the very time that Ana had met her grim fate. These facts weighed heavily on him – each piece a fragment in a deeply intricate puzzle.\n\n“Quite the nanny we have here,” Winston murmured to himself, starting the engine to make his way to the Johnson estate. Details done, actions justified; yet an unresolved cloud of doubt hung in the air. Only time would unravel the truth.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Marjorie\nB.

His stone-set face showed no emotions as he shuffled through the pictures of Derek ladled onto the cold marble splashed with ink and blood.\n\nHis eyes narrowed slightly as he picked up a photo of what could only be a harpoon. Blinking slowly in contemplation, Winston accepted this as a clue, however strange, and pocketed the photo.\n\nHe pulled out another, a picture of a gang tattoo, and subsequently made his way towards his next suspect.\n\nArriving at the edge of the harbor, he could smell the salty breeze that carried a strong odor of fish and seaweed. Loosely tethered to the slippery wooden dock with expertly tied knots, the sign of someone familiar with ropes, the fishing vessel stood tall and forbidding, bristling with equipment that included several harpoons. He saw the figure of a woman hauling baskets of fresh catch onto the quayside. Her muscles flexed under the strain, but she moved easily and without breaking a sweat.\n\n\"Hailey?\" Winston questioned, the name hanging heavy in the air between them.\n\n\"That's me,\" she replied, shooting him a glance, but continuing with her task.\n\n\"I see your job keeps you in shape,\" Winston stated, noting her above-average strength with a subconscious nod.\n\nIn response, Hailey shrugged, \"It pays, and the work isn't half bad.\"\n\nHailey radiated an aura of authority. This was her world, she belonged here and the others respected her. One of her coworkers passed by, tipping his head in acknowledgement towards Hailey, \"Evening, sister,\" he greeted. \n\nWinston noticed the respect she commanded. He also noticed the way her colleagues avoided looking at her—or rather, the tattoo inked to her arm. \n\nBefore Winston could enquire further, a family passed by them. A group of kids laughing and shoving at each other, a remote jammed into the hands of Hailey as they settled onto a nearby couch.\n\n\"Movie night?\" Winston asked and received an affirmative nod from her. \"Yeah and nobody likes the movies I pick but it's my house so it's my rules.\"\n\nIntrigued, Winston glanced at the television. His eyebrows raised slightly as he noted the opening scene of a classic crime thriller.\n\n\"They don’t usually complain when they don't have the remote though, do they?\" he asked, pointing towards the small device.\n\nHailey smirked, a recognition sparking in her eyes, \"Nah. They know better than that.\"\n\nAmidst all this, Winston noticed a book beneath the coffee table as he turned to leave. Taking a closer look before departing the apartment, he realized it was \"The Psychology of Criminal Minds\", a book known for its study on famous serial killers. \n\nNoticing his focus on the book, Hailey nonchalantly yawned, indicating a late-night reading habit and added, \"Gets me through the night when I can't sleep. Weird preference for late-night read?\" She shrugged as if it were nothing, the faintest spark of defiance reflecting in her steely eyes.\n\nBefore Winston could get a word in, a fellow gang member approached Hailey, muttering something about Derek’s latest public speech disrespecting their gang. Her face stiffened. \n\n\"We'll deal with it,\" Hailey said, her voice tightening, her demeanor shifting. She glanced briefly at Winston, quickly reading his inquisitive expression, and added, \"It's not good to let people trash talk your family.\"\n\nWith that, she sent Winston on his way, staying behind to discuss amongst her 'family' the disrespect Derek had shown towards them.\n\nAs Winston loaded up into his car, his thoughts traveled to her book and her expertise with rope ties. The knots were made by someone who knew their way around a rope, and her job on the fishing vessel could’ve easily taught her that.\n\nWith that, Winston drove off into the evening, the crime scene photos shuffling on the passenger seat.\n\nWinston found himself entering the grand synagogue. A revered place of worship that gathered a tight-knit community. The murder of Derek had sent shockwaves through the community, threatening to disrupt the tranquility of the sacred space.\n\nStanding under the magnificent dome, Winston noticed Angela, Derek's grandmother who was a highly respected member of the community. She was absorbed in polishing a large silver key - clearly bestowed only to trusted insiders of the community. She appeared not to notice Winston's arrival.\n\nAs Winston made his presence known, Angela seemed startled but quickly masked her emotions. \n\n\"My apologies for the intrusion, Ma’am. I am here about Derek,\" Winston delicately approached the subject.\n\nEven though her face remained neutral, the flinch in her eyes revealed her disturbance. \"That's quite alright, detective...\" she started, her grip tight around the key.\n\nWinston caught sight of her unusually strong hands and robust arms – strange for an elderly woman in her society. Upon asking, he discovered Angela has been an avid fisherwoman since she was a child and had won many titles at local fishing competitions. Her robustness was plausibly from her fishing background.\n\nDespite her attempt to evade pressing questions, Angela seemed uncomfortable and hastily brought the conversation to her past and future challenges in the fishing competitions with Derek. Her anxiety seemed tied to the challenges Derek brought forward and the atmosphere would tense every time Derek's challenge escalated. Derek really got to Angela, making her feel threatened and pushed at her limits in these competitions.\n\n\"I remember Derek grinning over that photo; where he caught you secretly betting against him in the last competition,\" Winston probed. \"He told me he intended to expose you at the upcoming one.\"\n\nAngela's reaction suggested his words hit a nerve, \"You see, Detective... Derek, he...knew something. He found proof of my betrayal. He confronted me about it, claimed he would tell everyone if I didn't stop it. I would lose everything.\"\n\nWinston registered the shock in his eyes. She had unwittingly given him the most crucial lead. Was this betrayal solely related to the fishing competitions or was there something even more sinister?\n\nAs Winston prepared to leave, Angela asked, \"Do you think this could have escalated beyond our fishing rivalry? Derek confronting me about the bets and all...\"\n\nHe chose not to comment, giving Angela an assuring smile before leaving. But the words lingered in his mind long after he left the synagogue. The certainty was that Angela's secret was at risk of exposure. Derek knew, confronted her, had proof, and threatened to share it. Angela felt cornered and threatened - enough to resort to desperate measures?\n\nAs he stared pensively at the large synagogue receding in his rear-view mirror, Winston pieced together the web of events and motives pointing at Angela. Derek's death in the synagogue, Angela's robust fishing skills, her betrayal, Derek’s confrontations, the high-stakes competition, the key, and her fear—it seemed like the seemingly kind grandmother Angela was not as innocent as he initially thought.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Libraries were supposed to bring tranquility, but now, this one seemed to echo with the whispers of a crime. The forensic team had found punctured wounds on Floyd's body, a mixture of peculiar cuts and punches, that were oddly similar to those that could be inflicted with a shiv; the kind that could easily be improvised with sharp tools. This had resulted in his untimely demise.\n\nHe had just visited Floyd's library, shifting through the catalogue of CCTV feed. It showed Zara entering the library during the day. She had a fairly regular routine, according to the library personnel. Winston also caught a glimpse of her re-emerging later, her steps were quick and purposeful. \n\nWinston kept his thoughts grounded, going through the notes he made during his interrogation session. Who was Zara, besides the latest burning face of the fashion industry? Her social media was a cascade of her embracing scissors, needles and other sharp filaments in her ostensible designs. Objects that, considering enough technique, can be reshaped into a dangerous weapon like a shiv.\n\nHe flipped through the photos of Zara's workspace. There was a toolkit - an array of sharp, glimmering instruments specifically designed for crafting fashion. They also gave Winston a hint of a chilling familiarity with the puncture evidence.\n\nLater, Winston found himself in front of a small, quaint house. From here he could clearly see it, the neighbor's living room window faced directly onto Zara's driveway. The neighbor, a night owl of sorts, spent most of his time binge-watching on Netflix. He had always been proud of his knack for precision-perfect timing.\n\nHe had another reliable source too - Zara's older brother. Often, due to an insomniac streak, he would visit Zara at night to check up on her. Each time, he noticed the room light would go off, followed soon by the faint hum of her car starting. \n\n\"Tell me again,\" Winston asked both of them in turn, \"when did you hear Zara's car start?\"\n\n\"Just after her room light went off,\" they iterated, almost in chorus, \"like clockwork.\"\n\nEvidently, Floyd the book lover's final day, a day spent around books, had an unexpected visitor - Zara. The pieces fell away like breadcrumbs leading into an obscure path. Winston knew this monumental work could unravel itself only with time. For now, it was time for the detective to take a coffee break, before immersing into the enigma once again.\n\nAfter a long day of gathering information and different pieces of evidence, Winston found himself heading towards the residence of a pilot named Catherine. Floyd, the victim, was found dead in the library with obvious signs he was attacked with a sharp object, possibly a shiv. Detailed research unclosed particulars about Catherine's time in the military where she learned to use a unique blade like a shiv. Catherine admitted that after her military days, she continued to feel safer practicing using her shiv which she always carried with her.  This significant piece of information is what led Winston here, to question Catherine directly. \n\n\"Good evening, Catherine,\" Winston began upon her opening the door, \"I trust you were expecting me?\" Catherine's slightly widened eyes suggested otherwise, but she still opened the door further, welcoming him inside. \n\n\"I am sorry for the inconvenience, but I need to ask a few questions regarding Floyd.\"\n\n\"Floyd?\" She asked. \"What has happened?\"\n\nWinston said, \"Our investigation revealed that he was continuously asking you for the money you owed him.\" He further added, “He was planning to take legal action if you didn’t pay, proof of which we found in his office.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Catherine responded, \"Yes, he was putting me under a lot of pressure to pay back.” She then pointed towards her busy calendar placed on her desk and revealed, \"We had a meeting scheduled today at the library to discuss the matter, it's right there in the calendar.\"\n\nConfirming Floyd's attendance at the meeting Winston adds, \"Yes, we've checked the library's sign-in book and confirmed that Floyd did check in for the meeting.\"\n\nCatherine shrugged. \"I was supposed to meet him there. About my debts to him.\"\n\n\"Your debts..?\" Winston asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Would you care to talk more about it?\"\n\n\"Not much to say detective,\" shrugged Catherine, \"I owed him money... wasn't able to pay.\"\n\n\"Why weren't you able to pay this debt?\"\n\nShe sighed heavily with a far off gaze in her eyes as truth revealed itself. \"I'd been missing a lot of mortgage payments. Had to sell my airplane. Just haven't been able to make ends meet...\"\n\nWinston shifted his gaze to a bag that sat on a nearby desk. Marked beside it were a few library books. Catherine followed Winston's gaze. \"I took them from the library,\" she admitted. That would explain why her fingerprints were all over the books.\n\nWinston smirked lightly. \"And the librarian confirmed seeing you there, around the time of Floyd’s murder.”\n\nWith an unsettling chuckle, he switched the topic \"I heard you were in the military?\"\n\nCatherine nodded. \"Yes, I was.\"\n\n\"The military - where we learn a lot, including how to use a shiv I am assuming?”\n\nCatherine chuckled lightly. \"Well, yes. And as you can see,\" she pointed towards her bag on her desk, wherein upon casual inspection Winston found the shiv, \"I never stopped practicing. It makes me feel safe to have it with me.\"\n\nThe shiv perfectly fit the description of the blade used in the murder of Floyd. It was the perfect weapon for a practiced hand to use quickly and quietly in a crowded library. \n\nBut Winston merely nodded to himself as he jotted down a note or two. \"You're full of surprises, Catherine.\"\n\nThey spent a couple more minutes talking aimlessly about life, the military, and Catherine's days in the air. But finally, Winston stood, getting ready to leave.\n\n\"I'll be back if I have more questions. Good evening Catherine.\"\n\nAs Winston drove away, his mind replayed back the facts he had collected throughout the day; Catherine's debts, her financial struggles, Floyd's continuous pressure for the money Catherine owed, Floyd's plan to take legal action, their planned meeting at the library, her continued practice with the blade, the missed mortgage payments, Catherine’s military background, the identified shiv in her bag, her bold admission of always feeling safer with her shiv and possibly most incriminating, the librarian’s testimony...\n\nHis job was merely about gathering the facts. The rest was for the law and the jury to decide.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Zara\nB.

He exhaled deeply, his weary gaze fixed upon the pile of evidence papers laid out in front of him.\n\nRussell. A local poet, renowned for both his artful wordplay and eccentric demeanor. Winston recalled attending a reading Russell held at the local café. Among the works presented was a poem about a labyrinth, a piece that unsettled all present with its vivid detailing. Each line made it seem as if the author held intimate knowledge of this mysterious maze.\n\nPulling out his notebook, Winston skimmed the pages until he stumbled upon a note from a conversation he’d had with Russell shortly after Isabella's death. Russell had seemed visibly distressed during that exchange, a reaction to a heightened argument they've endured together in the labyrinth earlier that day. According to Russell during their encounter, Isabella had threatened to expose a secret to the authorities, a secret that involved some grave mistakes from Russell's past.\n\nAs Winston set aside his notebook, a promotional flyer for Russell’s poetry reading found its way into his hands. Intriguingly, this performance had occurred on the very day of Isabella's unfortunate poisoning.\n\nFlipping back through his memories, Winston contemplated on his earlier investigations into Russell's background. The poet had lived a life of adventure before settling into the local town--having trekked to many exotic corners of the world. His fondness for the strange and unique influenced his writing, including several poems dedicated to exotic creatures, such as the poison-arrow frog.\n\nA printout of a photograph from an online source rested among the case files on Winston's desk. The image depicted Russell, standing proudly next to his illustrious collection of exotic animals, including a concentration of poison-arrow frogs. Word had it that Russell was not only interested in these deadly amphibians but also knowledgeable in extracting their lethal poison.\n\nReturning the photo to the pile, Winston could feel some weight lifting from his heart. All the pieces lined up--Russell's poems, his extensive travels, and his problematic history with Isabella. Winston was convinced that Russell knew more about both the labyrinth and Isabella’s death than he was admitting.\n\nHis attention drew towards the labyrinth, a stone's throw away. The maze was teeming with mysteries and undiscovered corners. Time to decipher what Russell perceived in that confounding maze. Restoring his resolve, Winston picked up his jacket and head out towards the labyrinth's inviting entrance.\n\nWinston looked at the facts spread across his desk. Isabella, a seasoned investigator, was to service a search warrant on Travis's tattoo parlor. Winston craved for that tattooed tight-lipped Travis to spill. He was hoping for a lead, a spark, something to light up this utter darkness of evidence.\n\n\"Request of service detail or better yet, harassment?\" Winston found himself talking to the desolate walls of his office, his mind was more focused on the black and white papers binding Travis to Isabella's death.\n\nTaking a firm grip on his coat, Winston carried himself to Travis's tattoo shop. As soon as he entered, he noticed the deserted nature of it. Empty chairs, vacant stalls, the evidence of Travis's lost clientele due to Isabella's investigation was blatantly evident.\n\n\"Prior to this... investigation, your tattoo shop seemed to be doing pretty well, Travis,\" Winston clicked his tongue. \n\nTravis scoffed, \"Yeah, that's an understatement, detective. All thanks to your beloved deceased. She had it out for me, ya know.\" His gaze fixed on a collection of inks, each vial more exotic than the next, glistening under the workshop's fluorescent tube lights.\n\n\"Her motive was to strip me bare till there was nothing left,\" he continued. \"My reputation... my livelihood… my specialty in exotic animal inks for tattoos, everything was at stake.\"\n\nHis eyes lingered on a particular ink a little longer. The label read 'poison dart frog ink'. Winston suddenly remembered their frustrating attempts to trace the unanswered calls listed in the notebook they had found in Travis' possession. A notebook full of numbers that went unanswered or unreturned.\n\n\"And what about this list of numbers?\" Detective Winston asked, holding up the notebook, reminding of the police's exhaustive investigations to trace them.\n\nTravis looked a little taken aback, “Oh, that. Ha, nothing of concern there, detective,” Travis shook his head, merging a sad smile with his wearied face.\n\nGoing over the facts, Winston visualized what this underground circle could be: Travis, a reputed tattoo artist, specializing in tattoos using a borrowed spectrum of exotic animal inks. He eyed the poisonous dart frog ink once more. His gaze came back to the man across the table. Dejected and slowly losing control of his own narrative, but broadly denying all allegations.\n\nUpon Travis confirming the ownership of the notebook, Winston moved on, \"It's no lie that Isabella wanted to expose your illegal activity, but why? Was she afraid you might harm someone with this?\" pointing to the collection of inks, \"Or there’s something else she had on you?\"\n\nTravis fell silent, locking his eyes onto a blank wall, \"There were things that she couldn't possibly understand, Winston.\" He managed to let out after a beat, \"Things I didn't want out.\"\n\nWinston rose from his chair, leaving Travis alone with his thoughts. He couldn't help but feel a shiver run down his spine, the web of evidence was slowly getting spun around him - his reputation, his cliental loss, the notebook filed with numbers the police had failed to trace, and his special palette of exotic inks; all pieces of a puzzle, waiting to fall in their place.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Giselle, who had been practicing late in the night, was found in this one spot, a syringe sticking out. The studio was eerily quiet.\n\nThe security guard for the night, Fred, was now on the detective's radar. Guarding the studio, running its lost and found, working around the property, Fred had a significant hold on the location. Among his responsibilities was to ensure the items on the premises were secure. Recently, a syringe was reported misplaced and entered into the lost and found - the very syringe that, as per the Coroner's report, had been used in Giselle's murder.\n\nFred seemed more nervous than an employee should be given the circumstances. Scheduled to check properties during the time Giselle was practicing, he would have had the opportunity to interact with her. \n\n\"Giselle...she was a hell of a dancer,\" Fred said, stepping away to look the dance floor. \"Here late most nights, always the last to leave.\"\n\nHe hesitated before continuing, \"She...she threatened to go to the authorities, about...about some things.\"\n\nFred's discomfort with the subject was evident. Giselle had found out about a few security lapses in the studio, and Fred was aware she had the evidence. She had threatened to report him, to show up his glaring disregard for the job he was responsible for.\n\nReflecting on the evidence, Winston looked at Fred. He was a night guard, in charge of property management. He had access to the studio, the found syringe, knowledge of Giselle's plans. He was more connected to the case than he probably would have liked.\n\nGlancing back at the dance floor, Fred stared long and hard at the place where Giselle's body had been found. \"I hear her sometimes, you know. The tap of her dance shoes. It's like she's still here.\"\n\nWinston gave him a nod, made his notes before stepping out of the dance studio, leaving Fred alone with the haunting echo of Giselle's dance.\n\nWinston shuffled the crime scene photos into a neat stack and replaced them in their folder. The image of the dance studio – clear aside from the single syringe lying in the centre – was fresh in his mind. He traced the edges of the file with a thoughtful brow and stood, straightening his jacket. The victim's godmother was waiting for him at her current workplace - the local hospital where she works as a nurse in her effort to pay off her debts, despite having lost her nursing job at a different hospital recently.\n\nImogen's life hadn't exactly gone according to plan. She used to be a respected nurse at another hospital, with a stable income, but now, despite her job at a new hospital, she was still struggling with severe debt, worsened by medical expenses she could hardly afford. One day, someone noticed Imogen with a set of keys that had been laying around the hospital. They were of a decidedly peculiar design, matching those from her former hospital. According to some people’s reports, they were similar to the ones used in prisons.\n\nHis first meeting was with Imogen herself. She was a middle-aged woman with worry lines that were etched deep into her face, a contrast from her professional demeanor at the hospital. Despite her situation, her eyes held a fierce spark of determination and resilience.\n\n\"Giselle was saving up for her future, you know,\" Imogen began, after the pleasantries were over. \"She was a tenacious dancer, no children to her name, but wealthy nonetheless.\"\n\nWinston asked about her relationship with Giselle, about her financial circumstances. Imogen was upfront about her financial issues, about how she had asked Giselle for help, despite being her godmother. She didn’t hide the fact that she had recently lost her job at the other hospital. \n\nImogen shared a story about an escape plan she cooked up once. It was detailed and quite intricate, considering it was made up on the spot during a party. It was said in jest over drinks, but the detail of the plan was plausible to say the least.\n\nWinston left the woman with a curt nod, wondering if Imogen’s elaborate plan was simply the ramblings of a desperate woman or perhaps, more than that. Her life, after all, had not worked out the way anyone would have hoped. And life, he knew, had a tendency of pushing people to do things they never thought they could.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Fred\nB.

Usually, his line of work didn't involve tracking down suspects in airport lobbies, but such were the circumstances - with available investigation time dwindling when it came to this particular murder.\n\n\"Well, you look a little nervous there, Stuart,\" Winston observed casually, curious about the noticeable discomfort emanating from the otherwise composed electrician.\n\n\"Just... I hate flying,\" Stuart offered. His eyes darted to the grimy airport terminal windows without meeting Winston's leveled gaze.\n\nDecades of police work allowed Winston to judge when someone, like Stuart, was being evasive about the truth. The seasoned detective decided to switch tactics for now. \"You know, Stuart, I've heard you're quite the hand with voltage. Been working as an electrician for several years?\"\n\nStuart nodded. \"Yes, sir. Always got my own set of tools. Everything I need to get the job done, including my axe.\" His fingers twitched slightly as he mentioned the tool, akin to a pianist remembering a familiar melody. Perfect for cutting electrical cables when necessary. \n\nWinston took note of this reaction and continued. \"Big day today, huh? Received a call to fix a power outage at the remote chalet. No other workers, no inhabitants. Just you with all your tools, including that axe of yours.\" He had to be careful with his words, especially considering Stuart's tendency to withhold personal information.\n\n\"Yes, that's right. It was at Cecilia's chalet. Power was out the entire day. Had to bring my equipment with me. Cutting off the old cables was messy work, but the axe made it a tad easier,\" Stuart looked slightly away again at the mention of the now tragically departed Cecilia. \n\nWinston let that dissipate into the stale air before continuing. \"And shortly after that, they found her. Found her in that very chalet.\"\n\nThe sudden silence suggested he finally got under Stuart's skin. However, before Winston could get another word in, the overhead speakers bellowed out the final call for Stuart's flight. \n\nWith his head still bowed low, Stuart stood up, hefted his luggage, and muttered, \"I'd best be going.\"\n\nWinston watched him walk briskly towards the gangway, hands gripping his carry-on bag tightly. The seasoned investigator knew a suspect could never be prematurely concluded as guilty and, in this case, he wasn't ready to tick Stuart off the list - yet. The subsequent chapters would reveal more... they always did.\n\nWinston gazed across the untouched alpine landscape surrounding Cecilia's chalet. It was an isolated spot, certainly. Waving off the last crime scene investigator, he stepped inside the chalet, processing the eerie silence.\n\nCecilia was a student at the local school where Alice, suspect in question, was a counselor. Alice had been not only on the verge of significant change in her professional landscape, but was about to lose her job due to a recent scandal. A noun as unstable as scandal, indeed. It turns out that the scandal she was embroiled in was about grade-changing; documents uncovered by Cecilia suggested Alice's involvement. That sort of behavior doesn't sit well with school authorities, because it undermines the values and ethics they strive to instill in their students.\n\nAs he skimmed through Cecilia's schedule for that day, he noted that Alice was the only appointment, and it was Alice who'd put it in the calendar. He remembered Alice as one of the leading figures on the school's camping trips. He'd even seen her demonstrating axe skills to the kids, the very same axe which had been laying untouched until recently in the school's woodshop.\n\nWinston had been informed that Alice had previously been seen carrying an axe from that shop. An axe could be used for chopping wood, maybe, but in a setting such as this one, it was a grim and dominating presence, a marker of something far more sinister. This, however, was pure conjecture.\n\n“Alice has always been very active with the students – often taking them out for camping trips.” Winston mused to himself. He tried to imagine the scene: Alice presiding over a group of children, expertly wielding an axe to chop wood for a bonfire, perhaps.\n\nAside from this scandal, Cecilia had unintentionally stumbled further into a dark web of secrets, uncovering evidence of Alice's extramarital affair. That sort of discovery could wreak havoc on a school counselor's reputation, with potential to bring about more devastating consequences.\n\nParting the drapes, Winston watched as the sunset turned the icy landscape warm shades of peach and gold. He realized that Alice had been alone with Cecilia at the chalet, that day. This fact added a touch of ice to the corners of his stoic heart.\n\nWinston considered how Alice's life was falling apart. A scandal, an affair, an impending job loss and now, a murder to deal with. As Winston packed up his notes and headed out, he had Eden, his secretary, dial Alice's number.\n\nBefore leaving the desolate chalet, Winston allowed himself a final speculative glance at the crime scene. Wilderness creeping forward, ready to swallow the blatant dark humanity demonstrated here. “Alice. School Counselor. Grade-changing scandal. Affair.” He muttered to himself. The irony didn't escape him.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Stuart\nB.

Nothing out of the ordinary. Her classmates know her to be systematic, picking up the pace at which she had been twirling the nunchaku around; she had been at this for a while. Today's training session ended with each student placing their nunchaku back in its storage area. Emma, being one of the last attendees to leave, noticed that the instructor was already preoccupied with another task and wasn't paying attention. This allowed Emma to slyly pocket her training Nunchaku, unnoticed by everyone. Emma usually attended these classes regularly, blending easily within her group, never causing a fuss.\n\nEmma's next stop was Stella's. Winston examined Emma's calendar and noted that she and Stella had an appointment back at Stella's home for a fitting. Stella liked having her fittings at home, right there in the kitchen. Their appointment was routine; the kitchen was the best spot for Stella to have a fitting given its large, airy space. Moreover, Stella had always been known to spend her mornings truly alone, right there in the kitchen. This allowed her to enjoy her solitude without attraction any attention or interruptions. There's no harm in using it as a makeshift studio.\n\nWhile Emma was working in Stella's kitchen, Stella had taken it upon herself to visit Emma's studio. Emma didn't mind. She knew her studio was a secure private space, no prying eyes to worry about. But then, something piqued Stella's interest. She found a hidden stack of papers from Emma's sketchbook. Intrigued, Stella began looking more closely at the sketches. They were designs of a new collection, never before seen. And as she scrutinized them, a glassy look came over Stella's eyes. These designs resembled her own unlaunched collection, she realized.\n\nEmma had arrived back at the studio to find Stella stiff with anger and an odd collection of sketch pages in her hand. Stella looked up at Emma, her features hardening as she accused her of plagiarism and threatened to expose her.\n\nDespite Emma's flair for art and design, this niche of Stella's discovery in her studio led Winston back to the martial arts class and how Emma had learned to expertly handle the nunchaku. He found it peculiar that such a unique weapon was the weapon of choice in Stella's demise. More peculiar and somewhat perplexing was how Emma would have found an opportunity to carry a pair of the increasingly rare weapon, nunchaku to the crime scene without anyone noticing. This case was turning out to be more intriguing than Winston had initially assumed; a fashion designer, a nunchaku, and a quiet kitchen.\n\nWhile smoking on his half-bitten down cigar, Winston rubbed the corner of his eye, trying to make sense of the gruesome, disarming photographs of Stella's murder scene in her own kitchen.\n\nThere was a mere few facts he had that could be of any substance for the detective, one of which was that nunchaku was held responsible for the cause of death, synonymous with martial arts, that made Winston think of Milton, a martial arts enthusiast appearing rather benign.\n\nAnother fact he'd picked up on was that Milton had been invited by Stella for dinner that fatal night. Winston stomped out his cigar, inaudibly muttered 'no holds barred,' and prepared to interview his suspect of interest - Milton.\n\nArriving at the local dojo, after a short spar, a sweat-drenched Milton, sporting his martial arts certification belt, made his way over to Winston.\n\n\"Hi Detective,\" greeted Milton offering a tepid smile.\n\n\"Milton,\" acknowledged Winston commenting, \"see you're stickin' to your trainin' regimen.\"\n\nAdjusting his martial arts belt, Milton nodded, \"It's a passion, yes sir, good way to keep fit.\"\n\n\"You were invited to Stella's last night for dinner, ain't that right?\" inquired Winston, his eyes never leaving Milton's face.\n\nTaken aback by Winston's sudden mention of Stella, Milton blurted, \"Y-yes. I was invited...we were good friends and I was often at her place for dinner. I found out this morning...that she was murdered in her own kitchen after dinner.\"\n\nOne eyebrow arched skeptically, Winston questioned further, \"and you left her house when, after dessert?\"\n\n\"Got a call from trace analysis,\" Winston's phone intercepted abruptly, \"looks like the local journalist sent over some more pictures of Milton. He was captured in various locations, which we later discovered were areas of Tommy's gang activity.\"\n\n\"Winston, we also got a picture of Milton with Tommy at the local bar,\" the voice continued, \"judging from the photo, Tommy's living up to his reputation as a troublemaker - even in the bar, his henchmen are always around him.\"\n\n\"Milton, how'd you account for your presence at these 'areas of interest'?\" Winston asked, showing him the freshly received photos over the phone.\n\nMilton looked stunned, \"I had...I had no idea about this. I did meet Tommy once at the bar, but...\"\n\nBefore he could finish his defense, Winston wrapped up, \"It's getting late, Milton, let's continue this another day.\"\n\nAs Winston drove off, he glanced at another picture sent over from forensics featuring Milton and Tommy, both laughing over drinks at a local bar with Tommy's henchmen lurking in the background, serving as a chilling background to his already twisted thoughts of the case.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The hunting shop sign creaking in the wind was a well-known fixture having Gordon's name inscribed in bold on the top. Winston knew very well that the shop was run by Gordon, who was as good a supplier of hunting equipment as he was a farmer. The murder of Harry, now known in newspapers as \"The Chalet Bear Trap Murder,\" had to be untangled.\n\nIn front of Winston, a rough-faced man, smeared with sweat and dust from his work at both the shop and the farm, set to work, carrying feed bags to the barn. It was Gordon, the local farmer in question.\n\n\"Hello, Gordon,\" - Winston greeted him.\n\n\"Howdy, got no time to chat. Gotta feed the animals before the weather worsens. These parts, we got some bear problems,\" - Gordon grunted in response.\n\nCatching a break, Winston moved towards the subject. \"I heard you had some form of disagreement with Harry at the farmer's market a while back.\"\n\nScoffing, Gordon refused to meet his gaze. \"Sure, we had words... I wasn't selling much, and he was selling everything. Fella won an award recently for his agricultural products while the market for my products was going under.\"\n\n\"You blame Harry for that?\" - Winston asked, laying the facts bare.\n\n\"Goddam right I do...\" - Gordon muttered, throwing a dirty sack onto a pile.\n\n\"Where were you at the time Harry was killed, Gordon?\"\n\nThe farmer dusted his hands, meeting Winston's gaze with defiance. \"I was here, at the farm. All day. You can ask anyone around.\"\n\n“As for the chalet where poor Harry met his end...\" - Winston started.\n\n“Yeah, Harry was at my chalet. It’s my property, and I’m the who decides who can or can't access it.\" - Gordon interrupted, more flustered now.\n\n\"Did you see anyone else around that day?\"\n\n\"Nope. Quiet as a mouse that day, just the bears and me.\"\n\nAfter that, silence fell over the now dark homestead. Winston considered the facts, the countryside, farm, bears, the market, the struggling sales, it all called for further investigation. But for now, he just tipped his hat and walked back to his car under the drizzling rain, leaving a brooding Gordon to his work.\n\nAs the sheer size of the chalet murder scene could overwhelm a lesser detective, Winston, stood firm. The victim, Harry, was a known critic within the food industry. His sharp tongue had a penchant for landing him in a hot stew of trouble. This time, it would seem, there was a rogue ingredient he just couldn't swallow.\n\nWinston strolled over to Dexter, a known acquaintance of Harry's and an avid food enthusiast himself. The man's love for fine cuisine was matched only by his fervour for his religion.\n\n\"Evening, Dexter,\" Winston began. \"How are you holding up?\"\n\n\"I'm doing okay... under the circumstances.\" Dexter wasn't the most expressive despite his harsh critiques.\n\n\"I heard Harry was very open about his thoughts on your religious beliefs,\" Winston continued.\n\nDexter sighed, \"Yes, he publicly mocked my faith during an event. Disrespectful, but that was just Harry.\"\n\n\"Dexter,\" Winston turned back to him, \"I noticed a photograph of you and Tony the Tooth having dinner together surfaced on social media. Where were you the night of Harry's death?\"\n\n\"I... I was there, having dinner with Tony, known to his friends as 'Tony the Tooth,' I've recently learned.\"\n\nWinston paused at the mention of that name. Tony the Tooth’s reputation proceeded him. Known as a racketeer and money launderer, his guilty verdict in a recent court case was infamous. Dexter's association with him, especially in a photograph in a restaurant notoriously frequented by other criminals, only bred more suspicion.\n\nChanging tactics, Winston delved into Dexter's rural interests. Dexter's love for hunting was no secret to the community; he was often seen in the woods around the outskirts of the town. Dexter was not only known for his hobby of collecting hunting equipment but also for his knowledge of various hunting techniques. One of the common pieces of equipment in his collection was bear traps, which he frequently used in the woods. Dexter was often seen studying these traps, enhancing his understanding of them.\n\n\"Care to show me your hunting gear?\" Winston suddenly asked, catching him off guard.\n\n\"Sure, I guess,\" Dexter replied tensely. He led the way to a shed, where hunting equipment including rifles and the commonly used bear traps littered the floor and walls.\n\n\"It's quite the collection,\" Dexter added, trying to read Winston's face.\n\nWinston, however, didn't respond. He scribbled down a few more notes before thanking Dexter for his time and heading back to his car.

The ropes held weighty silence, which is the exact opposite of what they were intended for. A far cry from the usual cheers and energy which should have filled the stadium that night as Cecil was scheduled to wrestle. \n\nExiting the stadium, Winston eased himself into his car and navigated the streets toward the home of Theresa, the victim's ex-girlfriend. As he made his way, he noticed a billboard with Cecil's face on it, advertising a recent public event where Cecil had appeared with a different woman, acknowledging their new relationship for the first time. \n\nHe stopped at a red light and tried to shake off an image of Theresa and Cecil together. Scrolling through social media on her phone, Theresa gasping with surprise, throwing the phone across the room, suffering, alone...\n\n\"Focus, Winston,\" he whispered to himself as he stopped in front of a house. As he rang the doorbell, he couldn't help but remember a detail he had come across while going through the night of the murder. Theresa was seen entering the wrestling ring that night, and to talk to Cecil, or so she claimed.\n\n\"Detective, you here for Theresa?\" a middle-aged woman opened the door and asked, pulling him out of his thoughts. \n\n\"Actually, I'm here to talk with her about Cecil,\" Winston handed the woman his card.\n\n\"I suppose you'll want to know about this.\" She motioned for him to follow her up the stairs to Theresa's room. The woman, who happened to be Theresa's mother, and a police officer, pointed towards a certificate. \n\n\"That is from a gun safety course she attended last year,\" she said. \"A course I insisted my little girl to take once she borrowed my off-duty pistol.\" \n\nStrange, Winston thought, as Theresa's mom changed the topic. She mentioned that Theresa had tried to get back together with Cecil time and again, but only to face rejection each time.\n\n\"She was emotionally charged that night and failed to hide it,\" her mother sighed. \"Being around Cecil wasn't easy for my girl, you understand, right?\" \n\nWinston gave a curt nod, mind gathering threads, weaving possibilities, but never concluding. He concluded his conversation, thanked Theresa's mother for her time, and walked out to his car. It was just another puzzle piece in this mysterious jigsaw he was tarrying to make sense of - A flower girl, a wrestling match, and an unexpected turn of love.\n\nWinston rubbed his temples, a familiar migraine beginning to make its presence known. He gathered the crime scene photos; among the images was a picture of a pistol found hidden within the bar. Authorities had confirmed it as the murder weapon for Cecil's death. He gave them another look and with a resigned sigh, shoved them into a drawer. Cecil's death had stirred up the city like nothing he had ever seen. Killed right in the middle of a wrestling match. Well, not quite in the middle. The match had ended late at Tiffany's bar where Cecil had been a referee.\n\nHe sank into the battered chair in front of Tiffany, taking in her imposing figure. Tiffany, a woman who was frequently seen by patrons at the bar, not only when she was working her bartending shifts but also sharing drinks with her boyfriend too. She was a fixture here, familiar to all patrons. The wrestling match had occurred at her bar that night, and according to the countless depositions, she was often seen at the bar, tidying up even during wrestling matches. \n\n\"So you were at the bar when the wrestling match ended?\" Winston asked, breaking the silence. \n\n\"Yes.\" She replied curtly. \"I work every night.\"\n\n\"Even on the nights of the wrestling matches?\" Winston inquired casually.\n\n\"Yes, even then. Business is business.\" Tiffany responded, avoiding eye contact.\n\nWinston took out his notepad and began to scribble something. \"What do you do here after the bar closes?\"\n\nTiffany shifted in her seat, \"Well, after the wrestling match, I clean up, I am typically the last person here since I am the only one who takes care of the cleaning.\"\n\n\"Did you see anyone else around when you were leaving?\" Winston asked purposely vague. \n\nTiffany hesitated, \"Well...a regular customer saw me meet with someone after closing. Shifty, he called him. He wasn't anyone I thought to worry about, just an old friend.\"\n\n\"So you didn’t know that according to the same regular customer who saw you outside, this 'Shifty' character had multiple outstanding warrants for his arrest?” Winston pressed. \n\nTiffany blazed red but didn't respond. Opting to change the subject, Winston asked about her conceal carry permit.\n\n\"Yes, I applied for a permit a while back.\" She admitted, glancing warily at the photos Winston laid out on the table, a picture of the pistol found concealed within the bar's refuse as though tossed away in a hurry.\n\n\"Any reason as to why?\" Winston asked nonchalantly.\n\n\"There's a lot of undesirable elements floating around here detective, a girl's got to feel safe,\" she said, avoiding his gaze. \n\nWinston nodded, scribbling down another note. He leaned back in his chair, gaze focused on Tiffany, \"Patrons have frequently shared stories of overheard gang-related conversations between you and your boyfriend whenever you're here. Care to explain that?\"\n\nTiffany stiffened, \"We talk about a lot of things detective, that doesn't mean we're doing anything illegal.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Winston concluded, rising from his chair. Winston knew he had to return to the precinct. There were still interviews to conduct and leads to chase. The facts were piling up and creating an unsettling picture. But it was up to the jury now to decide who was the murderer and who was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Tiffany\nB.

A bowling alley, deserted, save for a solitary figure slumped over in the congealing slick of his own blood – the scene drenched in a chilling morbidity. \n\nHis suspect was Mia, a waitress at the bowling alley. The late shift was her domain; her eyes, always heavy-lidded with fatigue, had fallen on a familiar figure, Joel, numbingly often. The man had his peculiar habits, including late-night bowling. Mia had a keen knowledge of that; it wasn’t easy to overlook when they regularly crossed paths during her shifts, Joel’s ball thundering and skidding down the shiny lanes.\n\nFiddling with a small, old key on his desk, Winston’s thought went back to his first meeting with Mia. He had found the key while cleaning her table after an interview and asked her about it. Almost flippantly, she mentioned it was for a private mausoleum in the nearby cemetery. The location was within walking distance from her workplace, an old cemetery cloaked in a gloom that seemed centuries old. The eerie part was her odd ritual; post her shift, her coworkers attested to seeing her trudge towards the graveyard regularly, a private pilgrimage in the dead of night.\n\nWinston vividly remembered his surprise when he had found nunchaku, a pair of them, while searching Mia's home. The night visits to the cemetery coupled with the ominous presence of the martial arts weapon was undoubtedly unsettling. Unraveling further, he found out Mia had been practicing and honing her skills with the nunchaku at home, late into the night. For years, she had been devoted to martial arts, with a particular emphasis on the nunchaku, the significance of which crept up on him like a poisonous vine. Her gym was known for teaching the use of this weapon.\n\n\"I suspect you're quite adept at swinging these,\" Winston had said to Mia, gesturing towards the nunchaku that lay on the table between them when he'd confronted her about it later. \n\nMia had smiled enigmatically, her eyes twinkling with the lethality of secrets untold. \"Keep your eyes open, detective,\" she had replied, her voice a chilling sotto voce lingering between them, hang enough in the suffocating silence.\n\nHis thoughts whirling, Winston stubbed out the last of his cigarette. The available evidence was yet to form a coherent story, but Mia was conspicuous. He had ventured into labyrinthian investigations before, but the mystery of Joel's murder felt like uncharted territory. Winston felt a shiver creep into his spine as he got ready for round two with Mia.\n\nWinston stepped into the dimly lit bowling alley, prowling between lanes like a panther on the hunt. An unusual place to be hammered to death, he thought, especially during the graveyard shift, but a good detective never questioned the chosen venues or the hour of the city's grim reaper. Winston surveyed the empty building, the only sound being that of his own boots echoing off the polished hardwood.\n\nThe bartender, one Rosemary – if her nameplate could be trusted – was scrubbing down a countertop at the far corner of the bar. Winston walked over, took a seat on one of the bar stools and introduced himself. \n\n\"I hear you were working here the night Joel was killed,\" he mentioned, as he watched her movements. \n\nRosemary looked up, her face impassive, \"Yes, that's true. It was my usual midnight shift, and Joel got murdered after we had closed down for the night. Wasn't much else to do.\"\n\n\"You seem to have keys to this place,\" Winston noticed, spotting a set of keys on the counter. \n\n\"Yes, I do, for closing hours,\" she replied, sliding the keys back into her jeans pocket.\n\nHe continued his questions, \"I understand you practice martial arts, Rosemary?\"\n\nFor the first time, Rosemary stopped her cleaning and smiled, \"Yes, that's right. In fact, I work out regularly at a martial arts gym. Nunchaku workshops are my favorite,\" she added, her eyes twinkling with something akin to pride.\n\nWinston nodded, imparting no judgement on her preferred pastime. \n\nSuddenly, a glint at the corner of the room caught his attention. A collection of weaponry displayed on a wall. Upon closer look, he recognized various martial arts weapons, including a pair of nunchaku.\n\n“My father was a big fan of martial arts. He left me his collection,\" explained Rosemary, noticing his interest. \"In fact, the nunchaku you see hanging on the wall is part of my personal collection.\"\n\nAs Winston stood up to leave, he turned to Rosemary, \"Did you know Joel well?\"\n\nShe hesitated for a moment, her eyes downcast, \"Joel... he was a good friend. He always wanted to help. And he was the one person who could save me from this terrible debt I'm wrestling with. But to my despair, he... he said no when I asked him for a loan.\"\n\nAs Winston exited the empty bowling alley, he couldn't help but mull over Rosemary's last words. This was shaping up to be a long investigation, a fact he was all too aware of as he walked into the piercing chill of the night cityscape.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Philip, a library frequenter, was dead, with dire circumstances suggesting a gruesome murder. The weapon, a coil of barbed wire, unusual for sure. As he walked into the salon, he saw a middle-aged woman, Maria with a multitude of barbed hairpins reflecting ominously under the lights. She was working away with a pair of scissors, her nimble fingers managing both the razor and the various hairpins with the dexterity of an artist.\n\n\"Maria?\" Winston asked.\n\nCaught off guard, Maria looked up, her eyes wide in surprise. \"Yes, detective, can I help you with something?\" she answered, never pausing her delicate dance of grooming. She clicked her scissors, moved on to her razor, then her infamous collection of barbed hairpins, all with the practiced ease of someone in her profession for a long time. \n\n\"I hear you've been doing this for over fifteen years?\" he asked, partially making small talk, partially feeling out the woman in front of him.\n\n\"Sixteen years, next Tuesday.\" She replied, her gaze deliberately focused on her current client's head. \n\n\"Quite a long time...\" Winston said, thoughtful. \"You ever do hair for a fellow called Philip?\"\n\nMaria paused for a moment, her eyes downcast. \"Yes, I did his hair once. He's the one found in the library, right?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Winston nodded, \"I heard about your usual evening strolls to the library. The one open late till 10 pm?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's quiet, peaceful. They don't mind if I bring my coffee inside. I even have a key, just in case I lose track of time and it's closing,\" Maria disclosed.\n\n\"I see. How about Robert? Phillip's fiance. He been here, recently?\" Winston changed the subject.\n\nMaria swallowed and cleared her throat, stepping away from her customer to face Winston. \"Yes, he came... to talk.\" \n\n\"To talk about the wedding, or about that time in high school where you confessed your love to him before he proposed to Philip?\" Winston probed.\n\nMaria averted her eyes, \"About the wedding... but, yes, we also brought up the past. I've been in love with Robert since high school, and I've been secretly carrying that love for years, you know.\"\n\nWinston observed Maria. Things certainly aren't always as they seem, he thought, as she returned to her client, her barbed hairpins dancing in the slightly unsettling light. The fact that the time of Philip's death aligned eerily with Maria's usual library visit was an added layer of unease. \"Well, Robert's supposed to marry Philip soon, isn't he?\" \n\n\"Yes, but things aren't always as they seem, detective.\" Maria's voice held an edge as she responded, her gaze being both hurt yet defiant, hinting at a deeper tale yet to unravel.\n\nBlowing off steam, jumping from coffee shop to coffee shop, Winston was back on track, unanswered questions regarding Philip's mysterious murder bouncing in his mind. Known for his capacity for violence to get what he wanted, Philip had a reputation; ironically, barbed wire, his common form of conflict resolution, had been the weapon.\n\nThe detectives at the precinct were all a twitter about the eccentric sound technician, Hugo. Out of all potential suspects they'd drawn in, one thing about Hugo was blinking on Winston's radar. Not once had any colleague, friend or customer ever been invited to his personal studio where Hugo spent most of his time. The man was protective of his private space, it seemed. \n\n\"I'm detouring to Hugo's office,\" Winston informed his partner as he made a left turn.\n\nThe professional layout of Hugo's studio stood testament to his skills. Winston noticed the different categories of wires neatly stowed away, labeled by type. Spools of common wires were neatly packed, then his gaze floated towards an unusual collection of unique wires, barbed wire included, labeled 'personal collection'. He stroked one with his gloved fingers, lost in thought.\n\n\"Hugo,\" Winston called for his attention, \"This is some impressive collection. Not everyone works with barbed wire in a sound system, huh?\" Hugo's smile was gentle, \"I just like to keep my wire knowledge versatile,\" he shrugged.\n\n\"I heard you missed out on this year's industry conference,\" Winston inquired casually. \n\n\"Yeah. Conferences are not my cup of tea,\" Hugo chuckled, \"Too much show and too little know. I prefer focusing on the actual job, here in my studio.\"\n\nCasual chat moved reflective as Winston asked about Philip, \"What about Philip? Ever get into a formal tussle with him?\" Hugo's rifle through a box of cables paused, \"No direct confrontation, sir, but I was an unfortunate audience to threats he made to my brother over a phone call. Nastiest conversation ever.\"\n\nWinston nodded, taking in the distraught sound engineer before himself. Hugo's brother owed a significant amount to Philip, everyone and their nephew knew that. It had been no blind gamble, but rather a bet gone awry. It had complicated Hugo's personal dynamics, certainly. Especially so since no one saw Hugo at the annual company holiday party. Usually a regular, Hugo's absence sent alerts.\n\nDuty kept Hugo traveling between different venues for sound gigs, with a vast array of tools tagging all along, wires included, also, wires very similar to the ones found at Philip's crime scene. Winston mulled over this kaleidoscope of details, knowing well the devil lay in their details, as he drove back to the precinct.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

A murder case at a bungee jumping site was definitely out of the ordinary. Today's victim was a young man named Mack, loud mouthed and cocky by all accounts. \n\nMack was bungee jumping the day he was killed. Oddly enough, according to the records, no one else was documented at the bungee jumping site that day, making this case even more peculiar. The first stop for the day was to visit one of Mack's housemates, a woman named Ana. They were seen leaving in the same vehicle from their shared housing complex the morning of the murder, and it was time for Winston to dig deeper. \n\nAs he pulled into the shared housing driveway, a nondescript car came into sight. He learned from neighbours that it was frequently used by multiple residents, but Ana had a peculiar interest in it. She would insist on driving whenever with a group of friends, later meticulously cleaning the car after each use. An idiosyncrasy of hers maybe, but a part of the puzzle nonetheless.\n\nWinston knocked on the door, Ana opened it warily, twiddling a cleaning cloth and spray in her hands and greeted him with a nervous nod. Ana gets nervous and fidgets with the cleaner and cloth when questioned. Winston could sense palpable unease as he started asking her questions.\n\n\"Ana, did you not join Mack and the others for bungee jumping today?\" Winston questioned, to which she responded, \"I signed up to jump. But I didn't end up going through with it.\"\n\n\"Any particular reason you didn't join the others, Ana?\" Winston proceeded. \n\nAna took a deep breath, \"Well sir, my faith doesn't really permit bungee jumping. Truth be told, I was persuaded strongly by Mack. I had even signed up out of peer pressure but couldn't push myself.\"\n\nIt was true – Mack was insisting that everyone in the group should bungee jump. Mack had reportedly also been vocal about ridiculing Ana’s faith, even encouraging others to join him in doing so. It was a significant factor in their relationship.\n\n\"Ana, did you and Mack leave in the same car for the bungee jumping event this morning?\" Winston gently pushed further.\n\n\"Yes. Yes, we did. We always carpool.\" She responded while anxiously using the cleaner and cloth on her car’s dashboard. Her eyes flickered nervously back to Winston, expecting the next question.\n\nWinston took a deep breath, standing up to leave, \"Alright Ana, that should cover everything for now. We'll be in touch.\"\n\nAna nervously nodded without looking up from her cleaning, wringing the cloth repeatedly as Winston walked away, left again with another piece to the enigmatic puzzle of Mack's murder.\n\nThe day was getting older and Winston was getting more tired, but the case was fresh, and he wasn't one to back down. He tugged on his coat as he approached the bashful teen waiting for him by the police station.\n\n\"Mackenzie, it is?\" he asked, extending his hand.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right.\" The slight lisp, overlaid with blanket anxiety, confirmed what the school reports suggested.\n\n\"You were at the site when Mack... erm... you know,\" Winston's voice was methodical, calm -- almost robotic. The suspicion on Mackenzie was not unfounded - the security cameras showed him buying nunchaku a week before. \n\nMackenzie shifted on his feet, looking away before answering, \"Yeah, I was there.\"\n\nWinston pulled out a small notebook, \"What were you doing there, Mackenzie?”\n\n“Bungee jumping, like Mack… Then I left. I didn't... I didn't do anything…” Mackenzie replied.\n\nInternally, Winston sighed at the never-ending waterfall of teenage angst this case was turning into. \n\n“Martial arts, huh?” Winston segued, gesturing to a bruise on Mackenzie’s knuckles. “Nunchaku particularly, I see? Training does include the use of those, correct?” \n\nThe change in Mackenzie’s demeanor mirrored the bitterness in the last month’s weather – dark eyes replaced with ice-cold ones. “Yeah,” he admitted, shrinking slightly.\n\nMackenzie always took pride in being the best at everything. So when Mack got everything he wanted - the promotion to team captain, the respect, the attention - it was a hard pill for Mackenzie to swallow. Winston remembered the team talk, Mackenzie was indeed the top candidate but it had gone to Mack instead. \n\nWhat clinched it was Mackenzie’s remarks about Mack, echoing whispers of dispute and bickering, lost in the crowded lunchroom. There were also multiple witness reports of the two seen arguing at the bungee jumping site previously. Mackenzie had indeed said disparaging, almost emotional things about Mack – all stemming from a potent brew of jealousy, Winston inferred.\n\nShifting later through the detritus of Mackenzie's life, Winston discovered the nunchaku that matched the forensics report. They were tucked away, but the layer of dust suggested they weren't a favored possession anymore. It wasn’t hidden, it was misplaced – discarded in the throes of developing maturity.\n\nAs the sun started to set, Winston could see witnesses, scattered across the park, repeatedly pointing to the bungee jumping scaffolding. It occurred to him, then, the narrative of the past days. Mackenzie, jealous and wronged, over and over, at the same sight. It was quite a sight. \n\nWinston, shuffling back to the station, was left with one thought - Looks like Mackenzie had quite an eventful week.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Among the pictures that were scattered in front of him, one was of particular interest. It showed a clear fingerprint, a crucial piece of evidence that was found at the dance studio. This single piece of evidence linked all the mysteries together and led him straight to one person: Homer.\n\nThe body of Nathaniel, a dancer in a quiet town, found at his dance studio had set in motion a chain of events that Winston would not ignore. Nathaniel had discovered Homer's shady financial dealings. Nathaniel had not just shared his dance routine schedule with Homer, but also the explicit bookings of his dance studio times because of their regular appointments. With his strong suspicion, Nathaniel decided to confront Homer about his doubts and had even started to send anonymous letters demanding money as a warning for his misdeeds.\n\nWinston stood up, glanced one more time at the grim photos arrayed on the table, then walked out, his mind set on the person he needed to talk with next: Homer, who had no alibi during the time of the murder and whose fingerprints were on the scene.\n\nHomer was a veteran when it came to numbers. He was both a friend and foe to figures, a financial advisor by trade. Today, he stood in his richly appointed home office filled with trophies, symbols of his past service in the special forces where he was specifically trained in the use of a blowgun. Highlight among these were carefully arranged and meticulously cleaned blowguns-- a recreational activity he enjoyed in his spare time. All signs pointed to Homer acquiring another blowgun recently, adding to his peculiar collection, which he kept in clear view.\n\nTheir conversation started with Winston delivering the hard facts-- the studio bookings that Homer possessed, the anonymous letters traced back to Nathaniel, and the lack of Homer's alibi. Then transitioning into the more circumstantial-- the suspicious activities at strange hours and Homer's history in the special forces, and finally, the gruesome reveal of Nathaniel's murder.\n\n\"You haven't been having an easy time, have you?\" He pointed to the letters, then asked, \"Those threats...those payments? They're from Nathaniel, aren't they?”\n\nBuilding up the pressure further, Winston bluntly asked, \"I suppose you were practicing with your newly purchased blowgun during the time of Nathaniel's murder?\"\n\n\"Well yes, Detective, I was. Just a few days ago,\" Homer confessed, beginning to look nervous.\n\nThe story ended with Winston stepping out into the bright afternoon, his mind full of vital clues and connected dots, leaving Homer amidst the shadows of his room.\n\nWinston slumped in the chair of the dance studio's private box, glancing down at the floor below. Nathaniel's body was still outlined in chalk, a grim reminder of the night's gruesome proceedings. He'd been conducting a standard interview with Clara, the unfortunate woman who'd discovered the body and was last seen near the dance studio shortly before Nathaniel's body was discovered. A tear trailed her cheek as Winston gently asked her the last time she'd seen Nathaniel alive.\n\n\"Shortly before I...found him,\" Clara managed through her poorly disguised sobs. \"Right here in the studio. He was my cousin, you know?\"\n\n\"I know,\" Winston replied softly, nursing his cooling coffee. \"And you're a dancer too, aren't you, Clara?\"\n\nShe wiped the trail of the tear from her face, nodding uneasily. \"Yes, I love dancing. Is it relevant, detective?\"\n\n\"Everything's relevant at this stage,\" he assured her. Clara sighed, delicate fingers playing with the collar of her blouse in a gesture of anxiety. Winston noted the trouble she had staying still, and how she avoided eye contact. \n\n\"And you spend most of your time alone at home, don't you?\" Winston added, following a thought. \n\nClara seemed taken aback at the sudden shift in topic, then nodded slowly. \"Yes I do, between dance practices, I prefer the solace of my room. I seldom go out with friends. It's just not my thing.\"\n\n\"Now, I understand there's been some trouble at home,\" Winston ventured, setting his coffee down. \"Your pearl necklace went missing, didn't it?\"\n\nClara's eyes instantly sharpened, her gaze turning ice cold at the mention of the pearls. \"Yes. I am sure Nathaniel...he stole it.\" \n\n\"That's quite the confirmation, Clara. I remember your reaction when you reported it missing. You were quite distraught, weren't you?\" Winston asked, recalling her visibly upset expression. \n\nClara's eyes reluctantly met his, a flash of anger more evident on her face than tears. \"I confronted him about it the other day! And caught him red-handed wearing my necklace. Just before...just before he was...\" Her voice trailed off as she fought back another wave of tears.\n\n\"Is that why you have a high-security lock on your room, Clara?\" Winston prodded, watching her reaction carefully.\n\nShe disillusionedly nodded, a crimson blush staining her cheeks. \"No one else in our family does, but I felt it was necessary, what with Nathaniel's... tendencies.\"\n\nWinston listed through the facts in his head. \"I know that might've been painful to bring up, Clara, thank you,\" he said. \"Now, forgive me for the personal question, but I noticed you don't interact a lot with your friends, is that right?”\n\n\"I... I suppose so,\" she admitted with a sniffle, \"Most of my time is spent in the studio. Dancing helps me cope.\"\n\nAnd there was where Nathaniel's body was found, Winston noted. This wasn't going to be an easy case. Not by a long shot. As he was wrapping up, Clara hesitantly murmured something about a charity she had heavily invested in turning out to be a fraud.\n\n\"Was Nathaniel involved in this as well?\" Winston asked. Clara nodded, clutching a document proving Nathaniel's involvement in the scam, then said, \"We found this evidence of his involvement, yes.\"\n\n\"Let's call it a night, Clara,\" Winston said. As Winston was leaving the studio, he couldn't shake off the niggling feeling he got from the conversation with Clara. But shaking off feelings was part of the job, so he focused on the facts at hand, leaving the dance studio to the night and the lingering specter of death.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

His thoughts lingered on Ana’s abrupt violence.\n\nOfficial reports had solidified that aside from the victim, only one other person had been present that tragic night. Troy- the community’s spearheading missionary and the contender in that ill-fated paintball match, was reported to make an unusually early exit, shortly after the deafening explosion that had claimed Ana's life.\n\nWinston knew that Troy had been a missionary in war-torn areas, potentially having rich network of contacts from his time spent abroad. He decided that his next course of action was to pay Troy a visit. He found the man at the local church; brows furrowed and eyes distant, clearly lost in thought. The detective approached slowly, carefully observing the suspect.\n\nTroy looked up, noticing the detective for the first time. “Can I help you, officer?” He asked with an accent Winston could tell came from years spent abroad.\n\n“I believe you can, Troy.” Winston replied, deciding to keep the conversation light. “Must be tough work, serving in war-torn areas.”\n\nTroy shot him a surprised look before relaxing. “It is. But it equips you with skills you never imagined having. Back then, often due to shortage of help, I found myself offering assistance in handling explosives, in case of emergencies.”\n\nWinston made sure to keep his expression neutral; the statement held more weight than Troy probably intended to share. “I understand you were quite involved in the community.”\n\n“Aye, I was. And I hoped to get more involved,” Troy said, a touch of bitterness seeped into his tone, \"Ana was unfortunately not supportive of that.”\n\nDetective Winston made a mental note of this as Troy continued, “She was the head, I guess you can say - the ultimate authority in our community. But I feel like, after all my experiences, I could be of more use.”\n\nThe church bell chimed, indicating the start of the evening prayer. The detective decided it was a good time to bring up the incident. “You were at the field the day Ana was murdered, weren't you?”\n\nTroy paused for a moment before nodding. \"Yes. I was participating in that game. It's heartbreaking what happened to Ana.\" \n\nTheir conversation wrapped up shortly after with a quiet acknowledgment. Winston knew he was far from solving the case yet, but he knew where to dig deeper. As he left the church, he pondered what lay omitted from Troy’s words.\n\nPerhaps it was due to the prophetic dreams Troy spoke about before Winston left or the rumors he’d heard of Troy being seen browsing black-market weaponry on a clandestine site. Neither fact sat well with the detective.\n\nWinston scanned the kaleidoscope of colored splatters that patterned the paintball field where Ana was last seen alive. The eerie feeling of standing on the same field where his friend lost her life was strange. Ana had been lost here among the harmless shots and splashes of color, in the same tragic game where a crime took place. The same game Bethany had registered for - the same game Bethany played with Ana.\n\nBethany, Ana’s best friend, was not only well known in this paintball field but also at the military base where she was regularly on duty. Her job there entailed around-the-clock surveillance of the site, ensuring the safe handling of heavy-duty weapons and explosives, including grenades. Bethany's upbringing in the military honed her toughness and her reputation of handling grenades or any other heavy-duty weapons was well taken in the base.\n\nWinston found Bethany near the edge of the paintball field, casually disassembling her marker. He wasn't the only one ever to talk to her, and he also took notice of the accounts of her fellow staff members about her behavior when personal questions arose. They mentioned that she'd often dart her gaze around nervously, avoiding direct eye contact.\n\n\"Mhmm,\" She said, looking away from him.\n\n\"We heard you were good friends with Ana,\" Winston said, watching as her eyes darted around again. \"You were both registered under the same number, you played the same games together. The same game that happened here?\"\n\nHer gaze uncomfortably shifted away, \"Yes, we were.\"\n\nBethany seemed to grow more relaxed as Winston steered the conversation towards light-hearted and non-intrusive topics about paintball games and strategies. Just like others had noticed, her guard would drop a bit, revealing her easy laughter and shared anecdotes from past games. But, every time the conversation tips towards personal matters, there was a discernible change in her demeanor, almost a physical reaction, and her eyes darted elsewhere.\n\n\"There's something going on that you'd like not to talk about, isn't there Beth?\" Winston prodded gently. She quickly shielded herself, and resumed her evasive behavior, eyes avoiding direct contact. Her behavior reminded Winston of the previous accounts of her tendency to change the subject when personal topics arose.\n\n\"Paintball, huh? Heard you were trained in the military before you got into this. How to use grenades, and such?\" Winston asked, attempting to dig deeper. Just as he expected, she shifted uncomfortably in her seat, and eventually announced that she had to leave for some duty at the base.\n\nFor the second time during their discussion, Winston watched as she quickly exited - this wasn't the first time, others had mentioned instances of Bethany walking away whenever the conversation dug too deep into her personal life. He jotted a mental note of her departures during personal topics, her discomfort with emotional depth and her habit of avoiding eye contact on personal questions. He wondered if he would ever get the full story.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Troy\nB.

They were at the wedding of another one of Nicole's clients, and the venue was abuzz with celebrations.\n\n\"I don't have much time, detective,\" she began, a practiced, friendly tone to her voice. \"Please. Tell me this isn't about the court case. Losing something significant like the case with Tracy... it could irreparably harm my reputation.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it is,\" he admitted simply. “Tracy’s malpractice suit... she's unfortunately the victim,” he added after a pause, knowing the weight his words would hold.\n\n\"What?\" The color drained from Nicole's face. She guided him to a quieter corner of the venue, away from the prying ears of her bustling staff. Her gaze turned distant, then she finally said it out loud, amidst the wedding buzz, \"I admit, I made a lot of mistakes planning Tracy’s wedding. Not my best work, that's clear to see.\"\n\nShe pulled herself back together and fell right back into the professional demeanor she wore earlier. \"See, detective, I’m not just a wedding planner, my whole business is built on my reputation for successful weddings and food catering services too.”\n\nShe let out a sigh, \"In fact, I’m trusted with preparing meat at these events as I have professional training in meat preparation. The cleavers, including the meat one, are essential tools for me.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" Winston agreed, eyeing the busy preparations before him once more. He noted the large set of knives, meat cleavers included, and other kitchen utensils stacked neatly on a nearby counter.\n\nNicole followed his gaze, \"I always check the obituaries to keep track of my clients, and unfortunately, one passed away last week. We had the funeral just the other day, a somber affair.\" She shook her head, sadness briefly touching her eyes.\n\n\"Hmm,\" Winston grumbled non-committally as he pocketed his notebook, faintly grinning at her bemused expression. \"Let's just say it's a detective's intuition.\"\n\nStanding alone amidst the bustle, he allowed himself a moment to ponder. Nicole, the wedding planner who found herself in a pickle with her disgruntled client, Tracy. Her recently acquired skill in meat preparation, and a significant part of her services being dedicated to it. How she wielded her set of cleavers, meat cleaver included, with practiced precision. And her annoying habit of checking the obituaries. Nicole's reputation and entire business rested on the premise of her being a successful wedding planner. He glanced back at the array of shiny utensils Nicole had at his disposal. Truly a fascinating case.\n\nDetective Winston rested his worn leather shoes on the edge of the desk, as he thumbed through the file regarding the murder of Tracy. A murder at a movie theater during a rock band’s music video premiere was a first for him. \n\n'Save for the worst', his grandfather always used to remind him while teaching poker.\n\nThe band in question was called “The Butchers”, and they were supposedly somewhere around the murder scene. He found the name intriguing, as he looked through photographs of the band shooting a promotional video at a local butcher shop, “Slice & Dice.”\n\nHe then examined interviews given by witnesses and people involved. That's when he came across the name 'Gloria'. She was an ardent fan of “The Butchers”, attending all their shows. “Slice & Dice”, he noted from her employment record, was also her place of work.\n\nRecognizing the significance of motivations and actions, Winston used this information to understand Gloria better. All evidence pointed out that Gloria was smitten by the lead singer of the band. She was a groupie, lost in the aura of the band she idolized.\n\nMoving on to details about Tracy, he found that she was in a relationship with the lead singer of “The Butchers.” Moreover, she had plans to announce this affair to the media. Drawing upon his experiences, he felt a love triangle at play, even though he stayed professional.\n\nAfter going through the file twice, he felt it was time to converse with Gloria.\n\n\"Miss Gloria, I believe the band was slated to perform after the movie?\" he asked, leaning forward.\n\n\"Yes. Everyone was eagerly waiting for it,\" she replied, her eyes fixed on a picture of the lead singer.\n\n\"All of you were present at the premiere; you, Tracy, the band. Is that correct?\" \n\n\"Yes, I... I never miss their shows,\" she confessed.\n\n\"I see, Miss Gloria,\" he responded, \"The Butchers have a committed fan base.\"\n\nSuddenly, he asked, \"Were you aware of Tracy’s intention to reveal her affair with the lead singer?”\n\nTaken by surprise, she nodded and softly said, “Yes.”\n\n\"So you were in love with him too, Miss Gloria?” Winston asked. Gloria looked at him in shock but after a few moments of silence, nodded again. \n\n\"Thank you for your time, Miss Gloria,” Winston said, standing up to leave.\n\nAs he exited “Slice & Dice,” he noticed a pile of promotional meat cleavers right by the door. They were a symbol of the band, he deduced, something they handed out to fans at their events.\n\nRegardless of the peculiar nature of this case, he had to remain focused. There were facts to be processed, people to be questioned, and justice awaited. After all, he had a solid hand and now, it was time to play it.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Nicole\nB.

The lights always seemed brighter after such a grim event. This used to be where Johnny, a legally adopted son of Jay, and Jay himself celebrated New Year's. However, tonight, their anticipated joint celebration was tarnished with tragedy. Jay was meant to accompany his son tonight, as he always did in previous years. Yet, today, the gaiety was marred by the spilt blood of young Johnny.\n\nTaking silent inventory of the night's events, Winston departed Times Square and headed towards the residence of his unsuspecting suspect, Jay. He received curious glances from the neighbors as he passed by. His presence was quite striking given they were accustomed to seeing the irregular delivery trucks from far-flung places, implying Jay's suspected illegal fishery.\n\nReaching Jay's estate, Winston was greeted with a spectacle bizarre yet beautiful. Carefully arranged insects, like war trophies, were displayed for all. The place breathed less like an extermination spot and more like an entomologists’ gallery. In their conversation, Jay fervently talked of insects' idiosyncrasies reminiscing often about his entomology degree he pursued in college. It was a knowledge accumulated over the years, he claimed.\n\nDespite such peculiar oddities, something else caught Winston’s attention. Jay's demeanor exhibited an aura of a grieving father who had just lost his child. Every word, every gesture towards Johnny was drenched in fatherly affection. This he observed as he subtly probed into Jay's Times Square hotel booking from that very night shared over their New Year's plans discussion.\n\nJay confidently produced the confirmation for his hotel reservation, confirming his presence at Times Square, booked for the very night of the murder taking place. He seemed unbothered, almost casual like discussing an ordinary routine, even when Johnny's intention to report his illegal fishery was disclosed. Winston found this revelation stirring. Johnny had confessed to him, and unbelievably, Jay happened to overhear their private conversation revealing Johnny's turn of trust.\n\nThe conversation took a turn towards Jay's unusual hobbies, including the exotic delivery trucks that catered to his needs, and the display cases filled with nicely arranged insects. Jay, light-hearted in his response, flirted with anecdotes trailing from his college days.\n\nThe air was thick with grief as they remembered Johnny. Loaded with information, Winston pieced together a clear perspective of the suspect. Yet the investigation was far from over. Something hung unanswered, unfinished. As Winston exited Jay's house, silence echoed the unspoken truths left to be discovered.\n\nWinston scrutinized the surroundings of Times Square. It was almost surreal that amidst the clamor and hustle, a murder had taken place here, Johnny's murder. The murder weapon was peculiar, a trident.\n\nDespite the city's innumerable faces, battalions of CCTV cameras, incessantly flashing screens surrounding the quadrant, a witness had spotted Karl here.\n\nClearing his throat, Winston began his interrogation. \"You've been spotted here today Karl, can you explain that?\"\n\nThe reply came quick, \"Yeah, I was here, detective. I come here often.\"\n\n\"You and Johnny had an argument?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Karl nodded, then his face grew grave. \"He threatened to go to the police about some documents he'd found. I tried to reason with him,” said Karl, his voice trembling slightly. “But we argued. We argued often. He had a hot temper, and I suspect, mad as hell he was.\"\n\nPeople swarmed around like an ongoing carnival, but Winston kept his gaze unwavered on Karl. \"You have a soft spot for history, don't you?\" Winston ventured.\n\n\"Yeah, I love historical weaponry. I've got a nice collection at home,\" Karl stated somewhat proudly.\n\nWinston knew, his suspicion was correct. The house search had revealed a Trident among Karl's collection of ancient weapons, now confiscated.\n\n\"Interesting,\" he observed. \"Used any of them? For fighting or such.\"\n\n\"Tridents... I took some trident fighting lessons last summer,\" Karl admitted with an awkward laugh.\n\nStrange coincidence, or just an indication of motives, Winston thought. Besides, the trident and Times Square; there was also that heated argument over some documents about his financial misdemeanors.\n\n\"Financial misdemeanors,\" Winston probed.\n\nThe look in Karl's eyes revealed something, but he simply shrugged, \"Stock market’s a tricky business, detective. Johnny didn't fully understand it.\"\n\nWinston thanked him for his time and left. City lights illuminated the square. Karl, now successful in stock manipulation, hoped to remain unseen by the police. But Johnny knew, and had discovered evidence of Karl’s illegal activities. Winston had a feeling, the city that never slept would soon reveal its hidden truths.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Jay\nB.

Destination: The flower garden of his suspect, Rex. Winston knew the victim, Jerry, had met him multiple times there, to admire his unique flower arrangements.\n\nAs he came to a halt, an array of colors lay before him, stretching as far as his eye could see. Rex was standing there, tending to his flowers. \n\n\"Beautiful, aren't they, Detective?\" he gestured toward his unique bloomage that surrounded them, small beads of sweat forming on his forehead. \n\n\"They truly are,\" Winston said. \"But, I heard that beauty doesn't come easy for you, Rex. And Jerry demanded a hefty sum of money for his silence, didn't he?\"\n\nHe paused, mulling over something before he responded. \"Well, yes. I was actually out here today collecting some native flowers. And yes, Jerry did ask for money. Threatened to inform the authorities about my secret operation, that I had been illegally importing those exotic flowers to make my arrangements unique.\"\n\n\"Jerry liked these flowers, didn't he?\" Winston probed. \n\n\"Yes, yes, he did. He often came out here, saw my arrangements in the desert. He especially loved the exotic ones I managed to source.\"\n\nWinston nodded a simple acknowledgement before changing the subject. \"Your neighbors, they tell me they often see you cleaning late into the night, through the window.\"\n\nRex let out a light chuckle. \"Well, running a renowned flower shop has its challenges, detective. My plants, they need to be cared for, and my shop needs to be spotless. It...reflects on my reputation.\"\n\nWinston had the inkling of a knowing smile, \"And you cannot afford to ruin your reputation? Especially since your reputation thrives on your unique selection of flowers.\"\n\n\"No... no, I can't.\" Rex’s eyes darted anxiously. \"You see, I have... a significant amount of debt from importing those exotic flowers. If people found out about my illegal activities, it would ruin me.\"\n\nWinston took that in as he surveyed Rex's home which was embellished with several security cameras. \"Security is a concern?\"\n\n\"I'm a bit of a... clean freak,\" Rex confessed, \"I tend to keep my lights on until early morning. And, well, the cameras just help me be sure everything's... as they should be.\"\n   \nWith the sun beating down on his back, Winston nodded, buttoning up his jacket. After he sat in his car, he took one last look at Rex's property. The exotic allure of the place was fascinating, much like the intricacies of the case he was navigating. \n\nWith the gravel crunching under his car tires, Winston pulled out from the desert, leaving the solitary florist behind. His work was far from over, but he was starting to pervade deeper into the mystery that swirled around Rex, the florist.\n\nDetective Winston looked out over the desolate desert landscape, it was a place someone could vanish without a trace. Jerry never had a chance.\n\nThe local paramedic Maurice was tasked with transporting Jerry across this barren environment. Winston had spoken to Maurice earlier who confirmed his last call had indeed taken him out to the desert with Jerry. \n\nWinston noted that Maurice was physically fit, as his paramedic work often demanded. He was no stranger to exertion, which also brought Winston’s attention to his utility van. Winston had been informed it was spotted in the desert around the time of Jerry’s murder. \n\nNext to the van, Winston found Maurice's usually well-stocked toolkit. A good paramedic was always prepared, but there was an empty slot. It usually housed a lead pipe, a tool that was often used to safely break windows during rescues. He recalled someone mentioning seeing Maurice carrying a lead pipe before the incident took place.\n\nWinston knew that Maurice had been a paramedic for quite some time, dealing often with stressful situations and difficult patients. He had heard whispers about Maurice's practices from other officers. They had been receiving a flurry of complaints about him from past patients.\n\nBack at precinct, he learned more about Maurice's work history. The records clearly showed a pattern, Maurice's unprofessional conduct seemed to worsen over time. His former nurse had reportedly accused him of unethical practices.\n\nWinston also learnt that Jerry was set to testify at Maurice's malpractice trial that was to be held soon. Jerry was the key witness and without him Maurice's future seemed more secure, but Winston dismissed the thought. It's just a fact, what it means was not up to him.\n\nA glance at the clock told him it was time to end his shift. However, there was one last piece of information that seemed pertinent - There were no reports of any other individuals around desert at the time of Jerry's murder. A lonely crime scene was indeed a peculiar one.\n\nAs the day ended, Winston decided to revisit Maurice the next day. The facts weren’t lining up, something just didn’t seem right. He had a gut feeling that they were onto something and the truth was close. Just a little closer.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Maurice\nB.

He was there to have a word with Julius, a Rabbi frequenting the chalet for religious gatherings, who'd been seen at the place not once, but twice on the day of the murder. It was, interestingly, the same day that Julius was seen carrying his sickle for religious rituals at his early morning visit.\n\nThe door of the chalet swung open on creaking hinges to reveal the tall figure of Julius, adorned in his traditional clothing. \"Detective,\" Julius greeted him, the same sickle he had earlier in the day- used specifically in Jewish religious rituals- hung on the wall behind him; a twin to the one that had ended Mackenzie's life.\n\n\"Julius, I'm here to ask you a few questions,\" Winston began, his eyes drifting to the small blade hanging behind the man. Julius nodded in understanding, stepping aside to allow the detective to enter.\n\nThe inside of the chalet was immaculate, all looked as though it was in its appropriate place, nothing before the detective indicated any form of struggle. As they walked deeper into the chalet, Julius spoke to him, \"I was wondering when you'd come around, detective. Yes, I was here in the morning with my sickle for a ritual, as well as later in the evening on the day of the incident.\"\n\nA part of him listened to Julius, another part of him was inspecting the chalet. Mackenzie's time of death had been reported at late evening; though Julius was seen both with his sickle and without in the morning and evening, it deemed crucial considering Julius was next of kin, the man inheriting Mackenzie's assets.\n\nJulius continued, \"I won't withhold any information. I've always admired the company he led, you know.\" Indeed, Winston remembered that Julius had been quite vocal about his admiration for the business. \"Not just the money, the dedication, and even as a part of the ritual ceremonies, I carry the ritualistic sickle admiring the power in the business world it represents for me...\"\n\nWinston nodded as he scribbled down his notes; he was a man of logic and facts, not assumptions. But it did compel him to raise an eyebrow at the information. Mackenzie didn't leave any heirs, and Julius could gain a lot from the man's passing. The facts were piling up, but he couldn't let it cloud his judgment. All he could do was seek the truth, and let the evidence bring the guilty party to justice.\n\nDetective Winston was surveying the scene of the crime. Mackenzie, a wealthy businessman, had been found dead in his upscale chalet, an apparent victim of a gruesome sickle attack. A witness had mentioned a tour guide named Yolanda, and this had piqued Winston's curiosity.\n\nHe made his way to Yolanda's headquarters just on the outskirts of rural country. The rustic landscape spoke volumes about the kind of territory she worked in. She led tours, predominantly in rustic areas, where heavy duty farming tools weren't out of place. Winston was intrigued.\n\nAs he arrived at her office, he couldn't help but notice that Yolanda seemed to be quite comfortable with manual labor. She was shoveling manure and didn't even break a sweat from the exertion. \n\nHe introduced himself and Yolanda immediately looked on edge. Their conversation was brief and educational. It seemed Yolanda had a penchant for adopting a new persona for every language group she hosted. Winston picked up that she was known as 'Sofia' to Greek groups, 'Isabel' to Spanish ones, and even adopted an Italian name with her Italian clients. With a sly hint of French slipping into her accent, he surmised she likely had a French persona too, although the name was unknown.\n\nAs he chatted with Yolanda, Winston couldn't help but notice a file cabinet, not unlike one found in a law firm, filled with documents. Yolanda caught his gaze and nervously mentioned that these files were a record of past tours she led, including information on the clients.\n\nWinston switched gears and asked Yolanda about Mackenzie. There was a change in her demeanor and she admitted that he had gone on one of her tours. Apparently, during the tour, Mackenzie had found a folder dropped accidentally by Yolanda. This folder had old records, documents and evidence of her dark past full of fraudulent activities and scams against her tour clients.\n\nOn a hunch, Winston decided to pay Mackenzie's lawyer a visit. After a brief chat and revealing his interest in Yolanda, the lawyer handed over a similar folder. Inside were the exact allegations pertaining to Yolanda's past with similar documentation as the folder Mackenzie found. Clearly, Mackenzie had evidence of Yolanda's wrongdoings, and had been threatening to expose her unless she met his demands which seemed to include monetary extortion.\n\nAs he left the lawyer's office, Winston took a moment to lean against his car, lost in thought. A long day of investigation had left him staring at a tangling web of facts and he had a long road ahead to unravel the truth. But that was okay. Detective Winston was in his element. The game was afoot.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Julius\nB.

His recent travel logs had him shuttling multiple times to and from South America, the only place where the frog that produces a toxic poison can be found. In just a few weeks of travels, he managed to visit the region several times. Closing the file, Winston grabbed his coat and made his way to Hector’s residence.\n\nUpon arrival at Hector's home, Winston was greeted with an impressive gallery of artwork. Though it seemed grim and somewhat macabre, a theme Hector had expressed enthusiasm for in conversation, Winston had to admit, Hector had talent. Each painting was meticulously detailed and chillingly realistic, with gruesome scenes of death and despair. Hector escorted him through, speaking of his passion and backgrounds; studying biology, specializing in amphibians, particular those native to South America, before taking a recent turn into the fast-paced life as a flight attendant.\n\nWinston moved through the house, noting the unusual abundance of crimson. \n\n“New project?” He asked. \n\n“A passion piece...” Hector responded, pointing out to a fresh canvas that sat in the corner, a pot of fresh crimson red paint on an easel next to it that Winston instantly recognized. He'd seen Hector carrying it home from the art supply store earlier.\n\nThe following morning Winston placed another visit, this time to the local skate park. Public records indicated both Hector and Roxanne, the victim, frequent activity in this park, perhaps an emblem of their youth, or simply an outlet to unwind. Even here, halfway across the world, Hector was diligent about signing in, a habit that placed him in the vicinity of the crime scene during the murder.\n\n\"Hector Barbosa\" was clearly listed on the sign-in sheet on the day of the murder. The times matched the timeframe of Roxanne's murder as recorded by the coroner. With no convincing alibi during the time, this only intensified the the suspicion on Hector. \n\nWinston shoved the paperwork back in his satchel as he stood up to leave. It was time to head back to the office. After taking a last look at the desolate skate park, Winston set a course back to his office. He had a long night of sifting through evidence and connecting the dots ahead of him.\n\nDetective Winston rubbed his temples, going over the case again. It had started with Roxanne, found dead in a skate park one hectic morning. The cause of death had been unusual...poison from a frog. Now his attention was on Stacey, having been seen at the skate park the same day of the murder.\n\n\"I did see her there that day...she always came to the same spot, worked on her designs...\" the teenage skater he was interviewing stomped his skate on a piece of wood. \"Used to be pro, you know, forefront of the game... Then when Roxanne got big, doing all the flashy moves...people started calling her out...\"\n\nIt was true, Winston reflected as he thanked the skater for his time, Stacey was known in combative sports as an expert. But her athleticism isn't the reason why she fell into his radar. The local pet store owner had a strange tale.\n\n\"Yup, she came in the other day and bought a peculiar pet, one of those exotic poison dart frogs... expensive, bright colors...\" The pet shop owner, a tattooed man in his fifties, explained. Winston recalled his previous conversation with Stacey. She had openly talked about her trips to rainforests, being an avid hiker, often running into wildlife. She had even mentioned her interest in studying about poison dart frogs.\n\nThe day had grown long. Winston returned to the skate park, standing where Stacey would habitually be. Having talked to a number of witnesses who confirmed Stacey’s presence during the same time Roxanne would be...too coincidental he mused. \n\n\"Roxanne liked this spot too...it became her spot after she started ripping off Stacey's designs. Strange, isn't it?\" a skateboarder mulled, watching him curiously, \"To die in a place where you've stolen so much?\"\n\nWith Roxanne's sudden rise to stardom, a career that fed off Stacey's unique designs, he had a sense he was close... if only he could outpaint the whole picture.  \n\n\"Roxanne didn't care,\" a girl clad in ripped jeans and a baggy sweatshirt frowned, the anger seeping through her defiant tone, \"Even when Stacey begged her to stop, she didn't care...said she'd made them better.\"\n\nWinston nodded and finally left the park, blending into the late afternoon crowd. This case was becoming increasingly convoluted. But he had an inkling about where the thread might lead... He would continue to pull.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

In his hands, he held a stack of emails, one of which indicated that Paige had set up a meeting with Iris on the day of her death. He had also discovered a certificate amongst Paige's belongings that showed she had completed a self-defense course complete with stun gun training. He also noticed that as Iris's direct subordinate, Paige was next in line to lead the company, particularly since Iris didn't have any family members who could inherit the role. Additionally, he held company accounts that show a gradual decline in profits, a likely result of Iris's stubbornness to cut staff numbers and her constant investment in unsuccessful projects. \n\nAn email, a key to Iris's car found among Paige's belongings confirming her access, a timestamp, and a set of scorched fingerprints were all he had. Adding to this, CCTV footage from the company consistently showed Iris's car parked at their workplace confirming her regular presence. Straightening up in his chair, he got up, stretched, and went to interview his next suspect on the list - Paige, who had recently been seen on CCTV footage purchasing a stun gun.\n\nMaking his way out of the police station, Winston found himself in a tall glass building, home to the company that Iris had managed. Upon entering, he confirmed with a coworker that the last person to see Iris alive was indeed Paige, taking Iris into a meeting. \n\n\"Detective Winston? Welcome,\" said Paige. \n\nWinston glanced at the trash next to her desk, spotting a receipt from the stun gun shop that coincided with the CCTV footage and asked, \"Have you been keeping up with your stun gun training?\"\n\nPaige looked taken aback, but answered, \"Yes, I find it essential. Safety matters.\"\n\nThe detective nodded, an unease creeping up on him as he thought about the circumstances surrounding Iris's death, wondering whether the profits would rise once again now that Paige was stepping up.\n\nWinston took a sip of his cold coffee as he lay his eyes on the glossy wedding album of Iris. Alicia must have done a flawless job for a wedding in this grandeurs scale.\n\nHe turned off the city streets, pulling into a small car park next to a utility store. Alicia was there, in the shop that sold stun guns among other things, surrounded by the cluttered mess of wires and bolts. Tagged along in her workspace was her office, filled with numerous taxidermy pufferfish that were unusually large and placed strategically for utmost visibility. As the owner and wedding planner, Alicia had to keep track of everything. Winston took a mental note of her electrical engineering degree framed on the wall.\n\n\"Alicia,\" Winston intoned as she finally looked up from her workbench.\n\n\"Detective,\" She greeted him coolly, \"Here to pick a stun gun?\"\n\n\"Actually, I'm looking into a case,\" Winston said, sliding the crime scene photos across the counter.\n\nAlicia's eyes scanned them but she said nothing. Her hand didn't shake even when he laid out the receipt his team had found in her apartment. A receipt for a stun gun purchased a week ago.\n\n\"So, tell me about this,\" Winston motioned towards the pufferfish on her desk. Alicia’s eyes lit up as she started passionately rambling about the intricacies of it.\n\nWinston picked up her laptop, left casually open on police databases. The business' financials weren't good - she was operating at a loss and had to borrow heavily from nontraditional lenders. This major wedding event must have been a boost for her, financially speaking.\n\nWinston got up, preparing to leave. \"Your work here, it's all very remarkable, Miss Alicia.\"\n\n\"Thank you for your words, detective,\" she said, her gaze shifting once again to the photographs laid out on the bench. \n\nWinston had no choice but to leave her to her pufferfish and stun guns. \"Take care, Miss Alicia,\" he said before walking out the door.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

In the very middle of the shop was an imposing stuffed grizzly bear, imposing its dead presence on the area.\n\nPaul was busy with a customer, chatting away about the rare bird species in the case next to the register. The customer, just one of many who had complained about Paul's excessive taxidermy talks, looked painfully bored, his eyes glazed over as Paul prattled on about the bird's curved beak, delicately preserved feathers and where he had obtained such a unique specimen.\n\nWinston leaned by the counter and asked Paul, nonchalantly, \"Do you do the occasional yard work in between haircuts?\" \n\n\"All the time,\" Paul responded, finishing up with the disgruntled customer and turning to Winston, not pausing his monologue about another piece of taxidermy. \"Yard work helps to make ends meet. I was actually at Faith's place just before...well, you know. I even had access to her kitchen whenever I needed a glass of water.\"\n\nThat seemed to shut him up momentarily, a somber silence filling the barbershop. Winston looked at him, intrigued. \n\n\"It's none of my business, Paul, but I heard your barbershop's been on the rocks lately. Times are tough, huh? Even heard you had to borrow from some loan sharks.\", he tried to sound casual.\n\n\"Yeah, it's been rough. Lost a few customers, owe some money here and there,\" Paul’s gaze wandered to the floor, swallowed by the fear of the loan shark's due date.\n\nWinston looked around and made an offhand remark. \"Maybe all this taxidermy is scaring them off?\"\n\nPaul defended his role, \"People don't understand! It's an art.\" His placid face turned dark, \"And nowadays people don’t understand art.\"\n\nA minute passed before he asked, \"Can I use your bathroom, Paul?\"\n\n\"Sure, Detective, right through that door and to the left.\", he said, his gaze falling onto a corner of the shop. \n\nHe let himself into the bathroom, noticing its cleanliness. Paul was meticulous, that was clear. \n\nAs he left, he asked if he could see the papers for Faith's insurance policy. \n\n\"Why?\" Paul’s face tensed up at the question. \n\n\"Just routine procedure, Paul.\" Winston lied.\n\nPaul hesitated before conceding, and then he handed over the papers. Winston skimmed through them, taking a mental note of the surprisingly high coverage and finding that Paul was indeed listed as the sole beneficiary.\n\nLooking straight into Paul's eyes he finally said, \"You know, Paul, sometimes it pays to be the policy holder’s primary beneficiary.\"\n\nPaul looked back at him, pale, but with a composed poker face as he uttered his last denial of the day, \"I had nothing to do with Faith’s death, Detective Winston.”\n\nWinston found himself examining a scene in Faith's kitchen, evidence strewn everywhere he looked. He took backward steps, tripping and almost falling on an oddly placed lawnmower at the end of the room. The heavy machine was terribly out of place and hinted at a violent use he found hard to reconcile with the peaceful intent for which it was designed; surely, only someone accustomed to wielding weapons could have wielded it so. \n\n\"Since when has gardening become an indoor activity?\" He muttered under his breath, the strange possibility of the lawnmower having been used as a murder weapon intriguing him.\n\nA neighborhood visitor claimed they spotted Clyde, a man whose name popped up frequently during interviews, in Faith's kitchen at the time of the murder. His visit raised suspicions as Faith's husband, Greg, was out of town.\n\nClyde had just been recently subjected to a publicly organized demotion in his military profession, an event planned by Faith herself. This was a peculiar twist instead of an expected promotion. The profound humiliation Clyde underwent was palpable. Faith didn't just demote him; she ridiculed his past failures in front of friends and colleagues. \n\nThen Winston found Clyde in his backyard, tirelessly mowing his large lawn. Given his military background, the sight of him comfortably handling the heavy gardening equipment was no surprise. Clad in an army green tank top and dirt smeared jeans, he resembled a typical middle-aged soldier.\n\n\"I hear you were out here mowing your lawn yesterday as well,\" Winston ventured, trying to sound casual.\n\nClyde simply nodded, \"It takes a while, you see. Large lawn and all.\"\n\nThey chatted about his daily chores, Clyde even admitted his preference for maintaining his own lawn. As they spoke of his military background, Clyde shared that he had extensive training in handling various types of weapons and machinery. The mention of this made Winston think of the misplaced lawnmower at Faith's house. \n\nAs the subject shifted towards the night of the murder, Clyde confessed knowing Greg would be away. There was an eerie ease in which he knew about Faith's daily routine, which would have left her alone in the kitchen.\n\n\"It was an open secret. Faith loved to bake, known to everyone in the neighborhood,\" Clyde said, his tone devoid of any resentment.\n\nWinston, before he left, broached the topic of his demotion ceremony. A grimace appeared on Clyde's face at the mention of Faith's sly ploy during his promotion.\n\n\"That was... regrettable,\" he muttered, \"Faith had her fun ridiculing me. I swore I would get even for such humiliation.\"\n\nAs Winston reached for the gate, Clyde, playing with the freshly mowed grass, added, \"Detective, she didn't just embarrass me, she made it personal. That day will forever be etched in my memory.\"\n\nDriving back downtown, Winston pondered over the circumstances surrounding Faith's unexpected demise and the uncanny presence of a lawnmower.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Jamal's empty chair, a token of a dangerous gamble. Too high of a stake, with a godchild as your appointed dealer.\n\n\"Lillian, was it?\" Winston began, attempting to keep his tone as neutral as possible. The woman before him, a young biologist specializing in amphibians, nodded as she squirmed slightly under his gaze.\n\n\"Jamal spoke highly of you,\" he said, casting an eye towards her drink. She gulped, but stayed silent.\n\n\"He trusted you,\" Winston continued, surveying the crime scene with his trained eye. \"Even was seen taking a sip from your very drink there.\"\n\nLillian straightened in her chair. \"Always giving him advice,\" Winston mused, a thought dancing at the edge of his vision. \"And always willing to try something new.\"\n\nIt wasn't hard to guess that Lillian had always desired more. The lust for power hung around her like an exotic perfume, intoxicating to those in her proximity. She wanted to be Jamal. Jamal, the casino mogul; his elusive empire tantalizingly within reach.\n\nOutside, the neon lights of the casino blinked erratically, casting an eerie greenish hue over the scene. A darting shadow caught Winston's attention - a strange silhouette of a rare species of frog in a glass tank, well-known amongst biologists for its lethal toxins, shimmered in the glow. An interesting pet for a woman so consumed with desire.\n\n\"Lillian, you're a herpetologist, we gather?\" Winston questioned, inclining his head towards the amphibian. She nodded, a glint appearing in her eyes. \"And you've been studying the toxins of this frog for years...\"\n\nDismissing Lillian, Winston surveyed the casino once more. It was a den of decadence, a palace of transient prosperity run by Jamal, the giver of fortunes, who had no other known kin but a science-smitten child drawn to the perilous allure of her amphibian pets.\n\nOne clear fact remained. Jamal had listened to Lillian and she... well, she was next in line for his throne. This was not a conjecture but a simple fact an observer might note, just as one might notice the inescapable presence of a rare poison frog in Lillian's possession.\n\nAs Winston made his exit from the pulsating hub of the casino, his mind turned over the night's events. Lillian, pacing the casino floor, her eyes on Jamal, and Jamal's undying trust in his favored godchild. Pieces of a puzzle waiting to be fit together. But that, he left strictly for the reader to sort out.\n\nWinston straightened his tie, a habitual tick when he was nearing a suspect. Tonight, that meant paying a visit to one Kimberly, a spry octogenarian with a fascination for amphibians one wouldn't normally associate with a grandma.\n\nWalking up the porch, he could see through a dimly lit parlor. There, Kimberly was found, hunched over a substantial amount of research papers sprawled across the room. Winston noticed the frequency of articles related to the extraction and lethality of poison from a particular species of frog.\n\nKnocking gently on the open door, Kimberly straightened, stealthily slipping an exotic-looking frog back into its terrarium, before turning her attention toward the unexpected guest. \"Detective Winston,\" she held out a hand. She was sprightly, yes, but he noted the careful, controlled movements as she moved.\n\n\"I heard about your recent acquisition,\" Winston began, lowering himself onto a lumpen crochet-covered armchair. \"Must be quite the conversation starter.\" He flicked a glance toward the rare frog, one known for having highly toxic qualities.\n\n\"Oh, it causes quite the buzz amongst my grandkids,\" Kimberly chuckled, her eyes twinkling with mirth. \"They're scattered in different cities, all of which I've been to at least once, you see. Every time I visit, they share stories about their friends also believing in these new identities I seem to be adopting. First a globetrotter, and now a herpetologist. Quite the adventurous granny I am!\"\n\nWinston smiled politely, musing over Kimberly's statement and looking at a family picture, recalling his information about her visits to her grandkids' residences in the different cities. \n\nThe conversation switched topics from frogs to Jamal, a man who Kimberly had a trusted relationship with, and the victim in this case. It was at the casino where Jamal choked on his all-time favorite gin and tonic, his body later identified as being laced with an unhealthy dose of poison.\n\n\"I saw you there that night, Kimberly,\" Winston said with a neutral expression. Kimberly just nodded, neither denying nor admitting to more than was asked.\n\nOnce finished, Winston excused himself, heading back to his car. He knew he had to tread lightly; Kimberly was a grandmother, but she was also a woman of interest in a murder case. As he started the ignition, his mind replayed the conversation and Kimberly's careful words. He knew he had to come back for another talk, but for now, he headed back to the station.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Lillian\nB.

Guy had been killed in a shopping mall, one particularly familiar to Winston's niece Peyton. Peyton was always there, in fact, she adored shopping. The unusual detail was that Guy's murder had taken place during the night. With a sigh, Winston pushed this aside for a moment and decided to pay Peyton a visit.\n\nUpon reaching Peyton's apartment, Winston immediately noticed some sports equipment scattered haphazardly around the place. \"Rugby practice, huh?\" he asked, trying to seem casual. Peyton simply responded with a nod, \"Yeah, I'm a member of the local club.\"\n\nWinston noticed a pile of items displayed neatly in the apartment. They were shiny and spoke of a fine collection. To his surprise, it was a collection of weapons. Among them, a pair of sais immediately grasped his attention. He filed that information away for later.\n\n\"So, Peyton,\" Winston started, settling comfortably in the chair offered to him, \"You been busy with work?\"\n\nPeyton nodded, \"Yeah, just been swamped with the daytime shifts, Uncle Winston. It's why I have hardly any time for myself.\" \n\n\"That's rough,\" Winston empathized, \"Doesn't leave you much time for your martial arts class.\" \n\nPeyton's eyes widened a touch. \"How do you know about that?\" she asked, confusion striking her face.\n\n\"Just trying to keep up with you,\" Winston laughed, feeling a twitch of discomfort across her face. \"Your instructor was touting your sai-handling skills the other day.\"\n\nChanging the topic, Peyton stood up with a little wince. \"Oh, sorry, I forgot my manners, Uncle Winston. Can I get you anything?\"\n\nUnavoidable, Winston had to ask, \"Peyton, where did you get those injuries from?\"\n\nImmediately, Peyton's posture straightened up and she looked offended. Almost bravely, she responded, \"I'd rather not discuss that if you don't mind.\"\n\nWhile he did mind, Winston set the topic aside for the moment, taking in the day's findings. He'd come back to it with Peyton soon, he decided, once he had a better understanding of the pieces fit into the bigger picture. After a few minutes of casual chatter, Winston gave his niece a pat on her arm and excused himself from her apartment, another piece of the puzzle falling into place.\n\nWinston rested his hands on the bar counter, glancing around the establishment briefly. The air hung heavy with the smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke. He turned his gaze back to Isolde, the bar's proprietor, who was polishing a glass nonchalantly behind the counter. \n\n\"Isolde,\" Winston drawled, \"I understand Guy was at your bar the day of his unfortunate incident.\"\n\nIsolde didn't skip a beat responded, \"Yes, Guy was here having a drink, and I was on shift that day,\" confirming not only Guy's presence that fateful day, but also her being on duty at the time of Guy's murder. As she spoke, Winston noticed her biceps strain and flex in a well-practiced rhythm, reminding him of her high-ranking position at her martial arts school. Trophies for accomplished martial artists, including several for the proficient use of sai, adorned a high shelf, a testament to Isolde's formidable skills.\n\nWith the confession out in the open, Isolde continued, her voice brazen, echoing across the room. Her racially charged statements towards Guy in the past were notorious, often a mainstay in her bar speeches. They were so intense that Guy had felt compelled to file a police report a week prior.\n\nAs the conversations in the bar continued, Winston caught snippets of racial slurs punctuating the noisy background, recalling the complaint report from local police that Guy had filed just a week before his death. Uncomfortably, he remembered it was this bar that the complaint had been filed against.\n\nHis mind shifted gears as he started examining the CCTV footage from the mall, showcasing Guy walking into Isolde's bar. Winston's gaze then moved to the sign above the bar door, 'No (Guy's ethnicity) Allowed', the same bigoted policy Isolde often repeated in her speeches.\n\nAs Winston inspected the items behind the counter, he noticed a vacant space, where a sai from Isolde's collection should have been. All eyes turned towards him as he pointed out the missing sai. The forensic team confirmed that this sai had unique, identifiable characteristics which matched the weapon used in Guy’s murder, indicating that this was the sai that took his life.\n\nOn Winston's list of places to visit was the town's martial arts school, run by none other than Isolde herself. Speaking to one of the students at Isolde's school, he confirmed that she was a high-ranking instructor, who had been seen many times practicing with a sai.\n\nBefore leaving the bar, he got a chance to speak to one of Guy’s closest acquaintances, who looked visibly distressed at the sound of Guy’s name. He confirmed Guy had felt upset by the racial slurs thrown at him by Isolde.\n\n\"That Isolde, she ain't right,\" he whispered, shooting a last glance at her still behind the bar. \n\nThe night had grown dark, and the bar louder, but Isolde was still there working at the counter, her unfazed expression contradicting the brewing animosity. Her determined gaze remained even as the news about the identification of Guy's murder weapon spread.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Peyton\nB.

He turned to his notes, frowning at the array of facts before him. This case, the murder of Hugo, was a complicated enigma, and the foggy morning mirrored his confusion impeccably.\n\nHe walked over to the climbing area, his eyes locked on the silhouette of a singular climber. As the figure came closer, the face of Wade, a seasoned mountain climber, surfaced. Winston had encountered Wade during his previous investigations when he was seen climbing mountains numerous times. He always found the man alert, his axe ready and maintained an aura of determined conviction around him.\n\n\"You're out here pretty early. The mountains talk to you, don't they?\" Winston asked casually, glancing over Wade's equipment. \n\n\"Yeah, they do,\" Wade responded, tapping the handle of his axe.\n\nWinston recalled noticing how commanding the axes looked, how Wade always insisted on carrying them on his adventures, whether it was a nearby cliff or a daunting mountain range. The axes served an instrumental role in climbing, but there was a hidden threat about them. \n\nAs the conversation shifted, Winston subtly inquired about Wade’s sister. It was common knowledge in the campground circles that Hugo had a lecherous eye for her. The previous day, Hugo was seen lurking ominously near Wade’s sister, arousing fear in her. It was quite apparent from her pale face after each encounter with Hugo. Wade was made aware of this predatory stalking by his sister herself. \n\n\"Wade, did you and your sister camp here recently?\" Winston questioned, briefly scanning the terrain. \n\nWade nodded affirmatively, a slight twitch in his eye was visible as he rubbed his hand over the polished surface of his axe. He mentioned they were at the campground on the day of the ghastly murder. Hugo was present there too, a fact that Winston verified in the campground log. This piece of information provided a jolt to Winston but he kept it to himself.\n\nAs Winston walked away, he turned back for one final look, noticing the tent Wade pointed at; it was a confirmation that they had been camping in the same vicinity as Hugo when the dreadful event transpired.\n\nWith the last image of Wade practicing strikes with his axe at an imaginary opponent vivid in his mind, Winston got into his car. The trail of facts filled his head, developing a labyrinth he planned to navigate, determined to reveal the truth behind this horrific crime.\n\nWinston ran his fingers over the cold side of his coffee mug, his eyes unfocused, drifting towards the crime scene photos splayed across his desk. Hugo's lifeless body was sprawled in a campground, an axe driven into his chest.\n\nThe crime had a brutality that begged attention, even from a detective like Winston who had seen more than his fair share of brutal scenes. His mind was stuck on Salvador, his primary person of interest.\n\nSalvador was unlike most of Winston's prior persons of interest, in part due to his unique claim that he suffered from a rare medical condition which reacted adversely with moonlight. While it sounded outlandish to Winston, he did find it odd that Salvador never scheduled any of his driving classes on full moon nights. When pressed on the subject, Salvador quickly deflected, preferring instead to brag about his latest batch of freshly chopped firewood.\n\n\"Lot of freshly chopped wood,\" Winston mused out loud, glancing at a photograph taken of Salvador's backyard, a handaxe casually leaning against the house.\n\nAs a driving instructor, it seemed more than a little odd to Winston that Salvador dedicated so much time to wood chopping. But Salvador was versatile that way; jumping from being a driving teacher by the day to a lumberjack by evening, all the while feeding a drug addiction that had been spiraling out of control.\n\nHugo, Winston recalled from earlier investigations, had been Salvador's drug supplier. He had mentioned to more than one associate that he was thinking about cutting Salvador off, tired of the mounting debt that Salvador was accumulating. \n\nPutting his coffee mug aside, Winston picked up his phone, dialing the local driving institution's office.\n\n\"I need to know the names of Salvador's students,\" he began, leaning back in his chair.\n\nThe receptionist at the other end of the line was hesitant, but eventually complied. \"Salvador is really good at what he does,\" she declared. \"It just that students complain about not being able to schedule classes during full moon nights and he always deflects questions about it.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston said, noting her words down. The mention of Salvador's moonlight 'allergy' triggered Winston's memory of a piece of evidence in Salvador's house - a unique collection of handaxes. One of those axes could easily be the murder weapon.\n\nFinishing his call and putting down his notepad, Winston sat back, his gaze returning to the photographs of Hugo's grimly lit face. The pieces were slowly falling in place. But he knew he was still far from the complete picture.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Salvador\nB.

He had been working with murders out in the city, but one in the solitude of the mountains... that was new to him.\n\nThe victim Santiago was a reclusive man who loved his solitude and his land. He lived on that mountain territory, lush with nature and confirmed stories of hidden treasure. An idyllic hideaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. A paradise he wasn't willing to share, especially not willing to sell. He loved his land and nature more than anything else.\n\nWinston glanced at his notes once more when a name caught his attention - Orville.\n\nOrville, an orthodontist by trade with a penchant for pistols, Winston noted, given the several on display when he paid a visit to the man's office. Orville was also a known hiker, often found rambling about the mountains touching Santiago's cabin.\n\nSantiago's cabin stood alone, hidden away in the mountains which held a deep fascination for Orville, something that Santiago was fully aware of. Santiago wasn't oblivious to Orville's intentions to purchase the land either, something he had politely but firmly refused.\n\nSitting deep in thought, Winston recalled the confirmation he had received of Santiago's solitude that fateful day. Orville had visited Santiago at the secluded cabin the same day of Santiago's murder. He had been invited by Santiago himself. An invitation made with an eerie statement from Santiago: \"\"I will be alone at the cabin, Orville\", he had said. Winston wondered at the oddness of that fact. Santiago had been firm in not selling his land to Orville.\n\nWinston shifted his gaze to a page in his notes that lingered at the back of his mind. Orville had purchased a pistol a week before Santiago's murder. The pistol bore an eerie resemblance to the murder weapon wielded against Santiago. In the solitude of the mountains, Santiago had been shot with a pistol. He had told Orville he would be alone.\n\nWinston sighed and leaned back in his chair. There was more to this case than met the eye. It wasn't just a murder; it was a fight for the territory, for a treasure hidden away. But to prove it, he needed substantial evidence and concrete proof. Deciding that he needed more time to weave through the complicated web he was tangled in, he stood up and decided to call it a day. Tomorrow, he hoped, would reveal some answers.\n\nWinston, now grizzled from years of experience, strode up the gravel path to the isolated mountain cabin. A camera was pointed at its only entrance and exit. It was a quiet night, just like the one Santiago met his untimely end. From the information received from the coroner and the timestamp on the footage, it was clear that the murder had taken place at the same time the cameras showed no movement.\n\nThe cabin was secluded, a haven for star-gazers, far removed from the polluting city lights. Inside he found Troy, a renowned astrophysicist, immersed in a difficult book about dark matter and the end of the known universe, hardly suitable party conversation.\n\nTroy rose to greet Winston, a customary politeness despite his reputation for being mute on any non-astrophysics discussions. \"Detective,\" he greeted, nodding his head.\n\n\"Seems you favor the life of an introvert, Troy.\" Winston asked, thumbing the worn-out book. Troy shrugged. \"I think I speak enough about astrophysics, people never catch up anyway.\"\n\nNoting the nearby table carrying gun cleaning supplies, he asked, \"Been a while since you've handled a gun?\" It wasn't uncommon knowledge that Troy, despite his academic leanings, had served in the military and even undergone firearm training.\n\nTroy gave a wistful sigh and gave a cryptic response, \"The universe ends with the big crunch, Detective, and some things, like firearm expertise... you never really forget.\"\n\nSantiago's last moments replayed in his mind as he continued talking with Troy. The latter had been seen at a local gun store recently, acquiring a shiny new pistol, the perceptive store owner even mentioned Troy buying ammunition that matched the pistol.\n\nTheir conversation ended promptly, as Troy resumed reading his book, and Winston made his way back to contemplate further upon the unfolding mystery.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Pinned to the top was a grim photo of Lola, the victim, marking another life prematurely ended. A set of intimate text messages from Lola to another man caught his attention, reportedly found by Isabelle. Winston found the content of the messages interesting, adding more intrigue to the case. Lower in the pile, there was a picture of Isabelle, his prime suspect. \n\nWith a dedication observed during her thrice weekly visits, Isabelle had become a familiar figure in her local dojo, her commitment noted by fellow practitioners. Winston dialed the dojo and had a brief but informative conversation with her sensei, before putting the phone back with a small sigh. Her sensei revealed that Isabelle had been seen sharpening her Katanas after each session.\n\nDavid, Lola's life coach, had confided a lot in Isabelle, spending a considerable amount of time alone with her, a fact that Winston found odd. Isabelle had not only found some of Lola's intimate messages, but she had also seen Lola kissing the unknown man, making her knowledge even more suspect. The phone buzzed back into life, David at the other end of the line filling Winston in on his last intimate conversation with Isabelle. Their relationship was unconventional - it didn’t seem standard for a life coach to be so close to a friend of their clients.\n\n“What brings you up here, Detective?” Isabelle asked when Winston arrived at her door. She was out of breath and had chalk dusted on her pants, evident either from her routine rock climbing training or her regular hike which she often indulged in.\n\nWinston followed Isabelle into the house and entered a room solely dedicated to her Katana collection. Some were ornate, clearly for show, but others showed signs of recent care, with the wear marks from constant sharpening along the blade, the same the sensei had mentioned.\n\n“So, you visit Lola’s mountain cabin often?” Winston asked, shifting the conversation. \n\n“Yeah, I’ve been up there a handful of times when Lola is alone. It’s quiet and at a considerable altitude, inaccessible without physical fitness, perfect to clear the mind,” Isabelle admitted. She described the layout of the cabin in detail, showing her familiarity with the place. But her voice seemed somewhat strained, the memory of seeing Lola and the man in an intimate exchange casting a shadow.\n\nThey talked a while longer about the trails to the cabin, which Winston rightly noted required considerable physical strength. The conversation then swung to David, and they spoke freely about their close, somewhat unconventional friendship.\n\nUpon his return to the dojo, Winston observed the elegance and precision with which the sensei moved a katana. His mind drifted back to the crime scene, Lola’s body lying in an eerily tranquil way, as if her death had been executed by someone trained in a lethal art. \n\nBack in the car, Winston flicked his cigarette butt into the darkness, a chill passing over him as he thought of Lola, alone in the cabin at the time she was killed. What a dark sense of humor life had, he reflected, as he prepared to tackle the case.\n\nAs Winston paced the floor of his small and cluttered office, he reviewed his notes about Lola's murder. The whole scene of the gruesome act was set in a secluded mountain cabin, salted wounds for the peaceful surroundings. She had invited Frank for a work retreat, a secret invitation that he told no one about, and Winston decided that perhaps it was time to visit the suspect.\n\nAs a biologist, Frank was surrounded by microscopes and lab coats by the day, while his nights were spent in a dojo, practicing martial arts. Winston's curiosity piqued upon learning of his weapon of choice, the katana. \n\nWinston carefully examined Frank's martial arts record and noticed Frank's regularity in practicing with his katanas. A clue that Winston found interesting was the fact that Frank recently acquired a sharpening stone. An unusual purchase when you considered his profession.\n\nFrank's laboratory colleagues had divulged that he often had a peculiar habit. He would abruptly leave work and colleagues found new insect bites on his skin afterwards. This could be nothing more than a biologist exploring his environment, but Winston had a gut feeling that there was more to it.\n\nWinston had also come across Frank's bank statements, where funds were frequently withdrawn to flight booking sites. Odd for someone whose work seemed to revolve mostly around his lab, but not out of the ordinary either.\n\nFrank's home had companion pets who were frequently ill during his unexplained absences. Curiously, this seemed to coincide with his unusual hobby of abruptly leaving his office and heading in the unknown, Winston made a mental note to investigate Frank's suspicious departures more closely.\n\nOn the day of Lola's murder, Frank's schedule had no entries. Couple that with an eye-witness account of him being seen near the mountain cabin and Winston decided it was time to reach out to this elusive biologist. As he dialed Frank's number, Winston knew that he was getting closer to unveiling the truth. \"Mr. Frank,\" he said, \"It's Detective Winston, let's talk.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

They were standing on the edge of the football field where the murder had taken place.\n\n\"Sophia,\" Winston nodded, looking out at the half-time huddle of sweaty, tired players - the same scene where Savannah had taken her last breath. \n\nSophia was a journalist. She'd been covering the match when Savannah was killed, following her usual line of reportage. Today, she'd been on the field, right where it all happened. Savannah's murder had occurred right at halftime and yet, nobody seemed to know anything. \n\n\"So, it's been a while since your reports on the military exhibition, correct?\" Winston asked, keeping his face calm but watchful to catch any change in her expression.\n\n\"Yeah,  it was a couple of months ago. I still have the flamethrower I'd managed to keep, for research and, you know... reminders,\" Sophia said, her gaze flickering toward the field. \n\nWinston nodded. He knew that keeping memorabilia wasn't uncommon in her trade. Did it provide Sophia with a flamethrower when she needed one?\n\n\"Savannah, were you two friends?\" Winston asked, keeping an eye on the middle of the field where everything had happened.\n\n\"We knew each other... She threatened to reveal my source, ruin my credibility,\" Sophia sighed, staring at her untouched coffee. \n\nSophia's job was at stake, Winston knew; in a field like journalism, credibility mattered.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell anyone about the threat?\" \n\nSophia shifted uncomfortably, \"I had heavily invested time and energy in this article. I was protecting my...trust in the field. My source was my lifeline.\" \n\nWinston didn't reply but noted her skittishness in revealing her source even now.\n\n\"Look, the match is starting!\" Sophia pointed out to the field as the whistle blew.\n\nWinston just nodded, eyeing the field where the murder had taken place. If he was to solve this case, he had to sift through the evidence slowly and carefully. Even when it came from a journalist faced with the threat of losing her job and credibility. Even when it was wrapped up in the middle of a football game.\n\nWinston crunched on a stale coffee flavoured donut while wiping away the grim remnants from the computer monitor in his rundown office. He had been staring at the sport section of the local newspaper that spoke about the location of the unfortunate demise of Savannah, a keen enthusiast and promoter of sports in the city, especially soccer who also happened to be a strong opponent of Larry in politics. \n\nThe photograph of the soccer field was chilling, almost like a badly done modern graffiti that had charcoalled the grass in obscene patterns. A flamethrower had been the murder weapon and such a trait of weaponry could point to only a certain group of people who had the experience to operate such a complicated tool of destruction, typically war veterans, like Larry.\n\nLarry lived in a secluded house surrounded by woods, and held his position as head of a local survivalist group. Very often, his colleagues complained of Larry turning off his phone and avoiding them after work. This lack of response to text messages, calls, or any other means of digital communication could only be explained by Larry's choice to retreat in solidarity and bare minimal social contact. \n\nWinston sighed, pushed away the paper, and prepared to visit Larry. As usual, in unsociable fashion, Larry declined Winston's invitation to join his colleagues. \n\nWinston knocked on the rustic door of Larry's eerie looking cabin. When Larry opened the door, he looked like he had just finished a drill. He was sweating, hair a disheveled mess, his posture was rigid and alert. His eyes darted to his wristwatch, hinting towards a habit that he exhibited during various events, checking time frequently. \"Larry,\" Winston said.\n\nLarry recognised him and invited him in albeit reluctantly. A quick glance around the room was enough to see survivalist instincts visible in every corner. In amongst the survival gear was a flamethrower, a common item found in survivalists tool kits. But Winston ignored it and tried to talk politics. \n\nLarry seemed keen to steer the conversation towards Savannah - his fiery political rival. Winston learned Larry had a habit of attending all the political rallies personally. Savannah's recent rally was public, held downtown at the center square, and as always, Larry had been present. \n\nTrying to make Larry more comfortable, Winston asked Larry about his social life and why he declined invitations to join others. Larry just shrugged, avoided Winston's gaze, and said he wasn't interested in what others were doing.\n\nHis answers lacked conviction, but Winston held his professionalism and didn't push any further. He thanked Larry for his time and left.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Sophia\nB.

He fought a sigh as he approached the doors, remembering the usual jumble of gizmos and gadgets that never failed to make him feel outdated. \n\nInside, a friendly-looking man with round glasses and a slightly off-kilter smile stood behind a counter, engaged in a quiet conversation with a customer. Seeing Winston, he excused himself and approached with a warm greeting.\n\n\"Officer, how can I help you today?\" \n\n\"I'm Detective Winston. I hear you've got a batch of new batteries in stock?\"\n\nDexter's smile faltered a bit, \"Yes, sir. Came in last week. Anything specific you're looking for?\" After an uncertain pause, he added, \"Our stock varies from these small pencil batteries to some real heavy ones, you see.\"\n\nWinston gave a noncommittal answer, observing Dexter surreptitiously. The man had a certain peculiar charm; he seemed more like an impish professor than a sales associate at an electronics store. Following the conversation, Winston found his gaze drawn to a large cardboard box residing in one corner of the store. However, noting the interest, Dexter mentioned his personal collection at home.\n\n\"Ah, customers just love looking through that large box of trinkets over there.\", he gently scratched his chin and a soft smile played on his lips, \"And there's another similar treasure chest in my living room at my place too.\" Catching his nostalgic glance, it dawned on Winston that Dexter always included items into a similar box in his living room at his home following each customer visit to the store.\n\nBy the time Winston decided to leave the store, he felt sure of his next course of action. He headed over to Dexter's home. The house was, truth be told, quite modest but left a comforting impression. The first thing he noticed was a bookshelf overflowing with chemistry textbooks, not the staple for sales associates, he thought ironically, recognizing a few from his own school days.\n\nHe found himself staring at a cluttered table which held a photo album. Picking it up, he flipped through. Each photo had a caption underneath, reminiscing good times spent with the individuals pictured. As he took in this personal element, he recalled a town gathering where the lighthearted Rose, having discovered an embarrassing picture of Dexter, couldn't stop laughing directly at him and sharing it with everyone attending the gathering. The picture was now a town legend, circulating far and wide.\n\nAs he put the album down, Winston glanced towards the wall clock. The late afternoon sun was shifting into evening. He decided to wrap up the visit. On his way out, Dexter engaged him in some small talk about their shared love for the town's food. It was during their conversation that Winston discovered Dexter had previously studied chemistry in college, majoring in industrial acids. Winston thanked him politely and went on his way.\n\nThe detective, Winston, had strong coffee in his hand as he reviewed the case files laid out in front of him. His current assignment was the murder of Rose, who was found dead in her car by means of an acid attack. The type of acid was identical to those found in Daisy's performances. The perpetrator got away, leaving only a vial as evidence.\n\nRose had frequent parking spots, and her car was often seen in the lot near the locals' favorite music venue. The night she was killed, she was leaving a concert that was being performed by Daisy, a singer scheduled to perform at the same venue near the parking lot that day. Rose also notably had a sizable life insurance policy, to which Daisy was added as a beneficiary just a month before the incident.\n\nDaisy was known for her meticulously neat dressing room. She claimed it came from her aversion to the generally dirty environment the venues offered. Daisy's music album sales had been falling drastically, attested by the revenue charts Winston was scrutinizing. Furthermore, due to the cancellation of many events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Daisy had been unable to collect performance fees.\n\nDuring the middle of the practice session, Winston visited Daisy, where she was preparing for her next performance. He noticed different types of acids in small containers labeled and neatly arranged on a side table. Upon inquiry, Daisy shared how she often incorporated the acids into her performances for dramatic effects. She jokingly added, \"You should see the mess they make sometimes; this place is never clean.\"\n\nWitnesses from the concert reported seeing Daisy and Rose leaving the venue together after the show. They appeared to be the only ones in the car. Daisy didn't hesitate to confirm, \"Oh, yes, Rose and I left the venue together. She was kind enough to offer me a lift, as my own ride bailed out.\"\n\nAs Winston left the venue, his phone buzzed, reminding him of Daisy's recent addition to Rose's sizable life insurance policy just a month ago. As he drove past the venue, he saw that it was right next to the parking lot where Rose frequented. With the vial of similar acid on his mind, the pieces were starting to fall into place for Winston.\n\nDespite making some strides, the detective knew that the journey to justice was far from over. Each new location and piece of information held the potential to be the key to unraveling the mystery behind Rose's death.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Dexter\nB.

Navigating his way through the maze of bookshelves and study cubicles, he found the man seated in a corner, engrossed in a tangle of wires and knobs. Hugo was a sound engineer. The smorgasbord of tools and wires – even a wild-looking barbed one often used in some peculiar sound gigs-, extending around him served as a testament to his profession and the variety of venues he worked in.\n\n\"Mr. Hugo?\" Winston interrupted, his voice barely a notch above a whisper. Hugo nodded, eyelids still glued to his work. \"I'm detective Winston. I hope I'm not interrupting,\" he casually commented, glancing at the array of wiring tangled in the engineer's hands. \n\nHe took notice of the barbed wire amongst the mix. A trace of unease settled in the back of his mind as he recalled the crime scene images: Philip, lifeless in the library-turned-crime scene, surrounded by scattered books and barbed wire.\n\nAfter a moment, Hugo paused his work and leaned back, engaging the detective. Hugo mentioned a sound engineering job he was working on at the library at the time of Philip's murder. His work, he explained, often brought him to quiet, empty venues like this after dark, be it a library, an amphitheater, or something else entirely, each requiring specific types of wires and tools, barbed wire included.\n\n\"Bit of an unusual pick, isn't it?\" Winston tried to sound nonchalant.\n\nHugo chuckled, revealing a collection of rare and unusual wires he'd acquired as part of his professional routines. He casually referred to his atypical collection as an occupational hazard, barbed wire included.\n\nThe conversation somehow segued to Hugo's family, particularly his brother. \"He's not the responsible, betting kind,\" Hugo sighed, mentioning a lost gamble that cost his brother significantly. \"Between you and me,\" he leaned in to confide, \"Philip could be pretty aggressive when it came to his debts. In fact, he was known to resort to physical violence to get his way, a tendency that worried me always.\"\n\nDetective Winston couldn't help but ask, \"Did you confront him about it?\"\n\n\"No, but...\" Hugo hesitated before confessing a private phone call he overheard between Philip and his brother. Philip, as per Hugo, had not minced words in expressing his threats. \n\nWith his booked time slot over, Hugo readied to leave. Winston noticed the lights around them were already shutting down. The library often stayed vacant during Hugo's setup and takedown sessions, he mentioned nonchalantly. \n\nAs Winston left the dusky library, he contemplated the quiet bulk of sound equipment Hugo had in tow, wires of all sorts jingling together. It left a disquiet in his gut that he couldn't quite explain. But as a detective, he was trained to never jump to conclusions. After all, in a murder investigation, everything and everyone was a piece in the puzzle until proven otherwise.\n\nAs Winston walked into Maria's salon, he was overrun by the smell of hair products and freshly brewed coffee. The salon itself was bustling, filled with happy chatter and the occasional hum of hair dryers. He was taken in by the sight of Maria, a veteran hairdresser of over 15 years, working diligently on a customer's hair, using an abundance of sharp tools, from scissors to razors.\n\n\"Maria?\" called Winston.\n\nShe looked up, her eyes catching the sheen of the barbed hairpins on her tray. They looked dangerously sharp - almost eerily similar to barbed wire.\n\n\"Yes, that's me! Can I help you?\" Maria responded.\n\n\"Just have a few questions,\" Winston muttered. \n\nMaria's salon, open until 10 pm every evening, was bustling. As he waited for Maria to finish with her current client, he couldn't help but notice a large unidentifiable bag resting in the corner. \n\nMaria then joined Winston, washing her hands before sitting across from him. \"Detective, isn't it?\" she said, having picked up on his official demeanor. \n\n\"I often see you at the library,\" Winston started, hoping his observation could break the ice.\n\nMaria's eyes twinkled as she answered, \"Yes, that's true. I find it soothing to visit the library after I close the salon at 10 pm. It's open till then, making it a perfect addition to my schedule.\"\n\nThey went on, revealing Maria's deep connection with the library—it came to the point where she became one of its registered trustees and was trusted with its key.\n\nLater, the conversation shifted to her closing activities at the salon. It didn't take long for Winston to realize the purpose of the large unidentifiable bag. After closing, Maria would routinely transport this bag to her car trunk, which she conveniently parked just outside.\n\n\"I heard from a neighbor that they've seen you cleaning your car in the parking lot after midnight,\" Winston remarked.\n\nMaria simply nodded, unfazed. \"Yes, I tidy up my car after a long day at the salon. I usually carry my cleaning supplies in there—it's easier to keep things clean on the go.\"\n\nThe conversation then took a darker turn. Winston disclosed the tragic news of Philip's demise—he had been found murdered in the library. His time of death coincidentally coincided with Maria's usual visits. The revelation hung heavy in the air, but Winston, true to his role, kept his thoughts in check. His job was to collect information. Deductions were left to the reader.\n\nAfter expressing his gratitude to Maria, Winston has left her to continue her work. Retreating to his car, he began considering his next line of inquiry, Philip's murder fresh on his mind.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Hugo\nB.

The winning grin of Floyd looking up at him from the grainy print. Alongside the article was another news item where Floyd publicly announced that he was preparing to climb the local mountain solo. Floyd loved mountain climbing. He always found solitude in the mountains - they gave him a sense of tranquility, something he seemed to have desired mathematically and announced vociferously, proclaiming his affection for solo treks. \n\nTaking a gulp of his black coffee, Winston shifted his gaze to another printout - Floyd's invitation list to his pre-mountaineering celebration and the subsequent solo climbing event at the mountain site. Francis' name was there, highlighted in a fluorescent green marker and was flagged for the mountain site visit. \n\nFrancis, a dedicated potter by trade. The artist held his craft close to his heart, even going so far as painstakingly using a specialized kiln for the inclusion of local insect fauna in his intricate pottery works. A kiln designed in a way to safely house the insects during the firing process, preserving their delicate structures within the hardened clay.\n\nWinston grabbed his hat and coat, his next destination was Francis' pottery shop. The craftsman's shop was filled with interesting pieces - bowls, vases, statues, lots teeming with countless insects immortalized in clay. \n\n\"Detective Winston,\" Francis greeted, wiping clay off his hands with a stained rag.\n\n\"Francis,\" Winston acknowledged, watching as Francis flitted nervously around his workshop, tidying up the pottery equipment. \"I heard you craft some interesting pottery with insects.\"\n\n\"That's right. Gather them myself from the nearby mangroves. Interesting stuff out there. Unique clay too.\" A glimmer of passion flared in his eyes. \n\n\"Did Floyd ever purchase anything from your shop?\" Winston asked, casually, moving to inspect the insect filled vessels.\n\n\"He...uh, he confided he wasn't aware of my situation,\" Francis responded, a slight wistfulness creeping into his voice. \"Business has been tough. I borrowed from some less... reputable sources, a loan shark. But with the low sales of my pottery, paying back has been difficult.\"\n\nLeave it to Winston to know what 'reputable sources' entailed. The phrase 'loan shark' echoed loudly in his mind. \n\n\"I see. Were you aware of Floyd's recent windfall?\"\n\nFrancis' face turned a shade paler. \"Yes, I saw about it in the newspaper.\"\n\nWinston nodded, plucking a small clay insect from the shelf. \n\n\"Maybe you should spend some time away from this shop, Francis. Take a break, maybe even visit the mangroves or go to the mountain site with Floyd? Could do you some good.\"\n\nFrancis gulped, nodding as he watched Winston make his way out of the store.\n\nThe crunch of gravel under Winston's shoes echoed through the night as he left the crime scene and headed toward his next destination. It hadn't been an ordinary Tuesday at all; what with finding Floyd's body on a mountain climbing site, his life ended abruptly by a shotgun blast. On top of everything else, he had just spoken to Floyd's attorney who informed him that Floyd had plans to alter his will.\n\nWinston arrived at his destination - Camille's residence. A quick glance at a recent receipt from a gun shop on the flashy car dashboard beside a valid shotgun permit and the credit card statement visible through the glass, hinted at the daughter’s extravagant spending habits.\n\nUpon entering the living area, Winston noticed papers scattered around. As he examined the documents, he confirmed they were the updated will paperwork the attorney had mentioned - the same ones found in Floyd's study. \"Interesting reading material you have there,\" he commented casually.\n\nUnderstanding that it was unusual to casually visit a murder suspect’s house during late hours, Winston wet ahead. The door opened to reveal Camille who invited him in.\n\nCamille responded with a brief toss of her head, \"Oh, just going through some of Dad's papers. You wouldn't believe the number of documents the man kept.\"\n\nWinston gave a slight nod and steered the conversation towards mountain climbing. \"Dad loved it, invited me numerous times,\" she confessed.\n\n\"And did you accept his invite this last time, Camille?\" Winston asked cursorily.\n\n\"Yes, I did. In fact, we were the only ones on the mountain. I was on the summit before they found dad\" Camille looked away out towards the window.\n\nDetective Winston, careful to maintain neutrality, moved on - shifting his attention towards the pile of papers on Camille's coffee table. As he picked them up, his eyes immediately fell on one - a loan document in Camille's name. \"You seem to have quite a collection here,\" he commented, keeping his tone light.\n\n\"I do have a lot of expenses, Detective.\" Camille defended. She quickly regained her composure and mentioned her recent firearm activities. \"I even took shooting classes last summer, you know, just for something different. I even got myself a valid shotgun permit. Oh, and they had an offer on shotguns, so I bought one.\"\n\n\"Shotguns, eh? Do you frequent any local shooting range for practice?\" Winston questioned, smooth and casual.\n\n\"I did have a couple of sessions at the local one after the classes,\" Camille admitted, moving around the room, her gaze absent. \"According to the range officer, I was a natural with a shotgun.\"\n\nWinston nodded, admiring her candidness. \"Well Camille, I appreciate your time,\" he finally said, rising from the plush couch, his mind spinning with the connecting pieces of the puzzle. With scant evidence laying on the coffee table and considerable clues hidden in their conversation, it was clear that this case was only beginning.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Ryan, a notable figure and beloved dance instructor and advocate for racial integration, was found dead in the wee hours of the morning. The news from the officer stated that there was only one person present, Rex, at the time of the murder. \n\nCrossbow, a peculiar choice of weapon, but Rex was a known historical weapons enthusiast and was found alone in the studio. Rex was a man known in the community to frequently utter his disgust and hatred for other races. He never shied away from making his views known and didn't even care about the public backlash he received.\n\nWinston quickly drove to the scene. His previous encounters with Rex had taught him that he was not the type to embrace change. Rex was a man of his unpleasant prejudices and it's appalling how such hatred could run so deep.\n\nWalking into the studio's vast echoing space, Winston noticed Rex hunched over a droning gramophone, a scattering of musical notes scattered on the floor. As if revealing a questionable love affair, the air was robust with the scent of violin rosin and vintage tunes. It was evident that Rex had been working that night on his compositions.\n\nRex then stated, in his usual gruff manner, \"Found something?\" \n\n\"I guess hard work pays off in its own way,\" Rex replied, confirming his solitary presence during the late work hours coinciding with Ryan's death.\n\n\"What an extravagant collection!\" Winston commented, looking at the decorated wall filled with a series of historical crossbows that Rex had acquired from an auction. Winston remembered people mentioning how Rex often admired his collection and how he even took crossbow-shooting classes. He noted the empty space in the wall display.\n\n“Yeah, I even took crossbow-shooting classes. Fascinating history behind each of them…” Rex trailed off, a twisted smile on his face. \n\nAgainst the backdrop of Rex's repeated disapproval of Ryan's integration views, the altercations Rex had with people from different races, and his significant collection of ancient weapons, Winston made it a point to investigate deeper into Rex's background and his activities during the late-night hours of composing music.\n\nWinston took a sip of coffee and set down the crime scene photos. Laying there was Ryan, a well-known political figure who had been involved in numerous scandals. His reputation was on thin ice, and his sudden death was making waves.\n\nThe unexpected detail in this case was the murder weapon, an uncommon choice - a crossbow. Word on the street, and confirmed by Mandy’s friends as they testified at the precinct, was that Mandy, a local tour guide, had an intimate relationship with the departed. Mandy had confided in them, and their testimonies, along with photos of Mandy and Ryan in intimate situations, could back this up. Unconfirmed, but still a lead nonetheless.\n\nWinston had done a little homework on the suspects and had found out that Mandy was not only into medieval war tactics and frequented the local archery range, practicing with the specific type of crossbow the murder was committed with. This alluring detail landed her on the suspect list.\n\nWinston finished his coffee, grabbed his coat, and headed out to meet Mandy. His briefcase also enclosed evidence of her fingerprints taken from the identical crossbow he found in her vast collection during a quick search warrant operation prior.\n\nThe sun shone brightly on Mandy as she stood at the entrance to the local museum, her usual station. \n\n\"Hi there, are you Mandy?\" Winston asked after her tour group had depart.\n\n\"Taking an interest in the local sights, detective?\" she replied with a smirk. \"Let's just focus on the tour,\" she tried to redirect, clearly uncomfortable with the topic. \n\n\"Mandy, we need to chat. About Ryan,\" he narrowed his gaze slightly. \"I was hoping we could talk here, if you don't mind.\"\n\nMandy's features tensed up a bit; she looked away from Winston and started pointing out a nearby sculpture. \"We don't need to bring up the past, let's instead admire the beauty of the Roman Centurion standing tall there,\" she said, once again trying to steer the conversation.\n\n\"No, I'm sorry, it's just that–\" \n\nA sudden wailing siren interrupted their conversation.\n\n\"Wait here, please,\" Winston asked before taking the call. \n\nWhen Winston returned after a minute, Mandy had a look of discomfort that strained the corners of her eyes, but she quickly tried to hide it behind a smile. \"Talking about the past can be… difficult.\"\n\n\"I've heard you were critically involved in the election campaign.\" Winston mentioned carefully, causing Mandy to look subtly relieved. \n\nA hit and a miss. He was on the right track. Picking up the photos taken from Mandy's home, he found what he needed. Mandy had her secrets and he had a job to do. \n\nReturning to his car, Winston spelled a silent thanks for the fresh pile of leads waiting for him back at the station, still lost in thought about the case.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

As the hands of time slothfully crawled to seven, he began his shift for the evening. Erika's friend and consistent prayer companion, Fatima, waited anxiously in his office. She insisted on stressing that Aubrey, their mutual acquaintance, had been spotted at the mosque earlier that day during evening prayer, a place Aubrey was not customarily seen. \n\nWinston slowly hummed in acknowledgment, checking his files as Fatima continued her tale. Erika, in fact, wasn’t just a friend of the thriving museum curator but an investor in his flailing business. Fatima explained that Aubrey, despite attempts to keep his operations afloat via high-interest loans, had been struggling to maintain financial stability. In passing, Fatima mentioned that a banker friend of Aubrey's had told her that the repayments on Aubrey's loans were going to double next month. \n\nWinston mulled over his thoughts, refraining from allowing his suspicions to sprinkle into the conversation. Instead, he queried about Erika's visits to the mosque. Dabbing at the water forming in her eyes, Fatima confirmed that Erika dutifully attended every evening prayer without fail. Was it possible then she had met her untimely end during one of these visits?\n\nLater, as Winston paced through the office corridors, he revisited the mosque's security footage. Indeed, as per Fatima's earlier account, Aubrey could be seen entering the mosque around the expected time frame. \n\nStill thoroughly perplexed, Winston visited the museum across the street. Aubrey stood there, overseeing the preservation and acquisition of various historical artifacts, his primary duty as a museum curator. As he strolled around the exhibits, he observed a collection of historical farming tools hauled in for display, including a rather menacing collection of sickles. \n\n\"Aubrey,\" Winston began, levelly maintaining eye contact, \"Unusual setting for you, the mosque. Isn't it?\"\n\nAubrey looked up from his inspection of an ancient agriculture tool, \"I go here and there, detective,\"  he replied curtly. \n\nWatching Aubrey's carefully calibrated handling of the tools, Winston quizzed him about it. \"Last year,\" Aubrey responded, \"The museum held a special exhibit on historical farming tools. I took a workshop to handle them appropriately.\"\n\n\"Impressive.\" Winston said before wrapping up the brief discussion, knowing he needed to revisit the mysterious circumstances surrounding Erika's death.\n\nWinston stepped into the bustling lobby of the premier hotel. He scanned the crowded workspace before his gaze settled on a slender man behind the concierge desk, busily attending to the guests' requests. It was Garry, the hotel's highly appreciated concierge. \n\nHis co-workers always found it peculiar though, how much detail Garry remembered about the guests and their desires, almost uncomfortably precise details were remembered and shared more than just what was needed for his job. Garry had a knack for remembering little details from conversations, often times, trivia from the recent documentaries he watched. Winston overheard him regurgitating facts from a documentary about the dangers of farming equipment to a slightly bewildered guest. This troubling affinity for detail chimed with the meticulous calendar filled with documentary premiere dates that Winston found after a quick scan of Garry's desk. \n\nWinston decided to strike up conversation with Garry, who seemed eager to take a break from the steady stream of guests. \n\n\"Nice cut on the lawn on my way in here,\" Winston said,\n\"Comes with experience,\" Garry responded with a grin, \"Spent years on my farm before this gig, manicuring my own lawn. Lawn care, tool maintenance, harvest, I've done it all. The sickle was always my tool of choice. After all, I’ve been given the task of maintaining all the garden tools in this place, including the sickle.\"\n\nThe way he talked about the sickle, it was clear that he respected the tool, but also was well aware of the dangerous potency from his past farming experience. But the way Garry straightened from leaning on the desk, his light chatter becoming scarce when the name of the victim, Erika, was brought up, caught Winston's attention. \n\n\"Erika...she did say something about...,\" Garry hesitated, his uncomfortable gaze flicking around, \"...about planning to report my past criminal records to the cops. Gave me real shivers, that girl.\"\n\nPrior to these events, it was common knowledge among the staff that Garry adjusted his work hours to suit his documentary schedule. But the notable changes during the days following Erika's announcement were peculiar. They were stranger still, considering Garry was seen bustling about, polishing tools and manicuring the hotel lawn on the day of Erika's murder.\n\nWinston left the hotel, mulling over the conversation back at the hotel. There was no denying his past experience with the sickle, but Winston found it hard to believe that he’d go so far as to kill. His already gnarled past filled with criminal activities now tangled with Erika's death and his sudden unease when she planned to report him. A mystery laced with curiosities, Winston had to tread carefully.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Aubrey\nB.

The fitness fanatic who'd apparently taken one too many steps on the treadmill. Murdered in his safe haven of a fitness center, of all places. The murder weapon: a hunting knife, savage and oddly out of place in the sterile, health-centered environment. The time of the unfortunate event was firmly during Harvey's regular workout slot.\n\nHe let out a slow breath and maneuvered his way to the very center of his investigation. The one man who seemed to be the focus of this swirl of confusion: Harvey. \n\nWinston located Harvey at the same fitness center, engaged in a heavy workout regime. Harvey was an astronaut, disciplined and rigorously trained, his steely determination ever evident. His expression was of hard-angled concentration as he executed his exercises with habitual precision. \n\n\"Seems like you never miss a day, eh, Harvey?\" Winston called out to him, keeping his tone casual. Harvey stopped his workout and turned, his face momentarily losing its studied calm as he registered Rufus' name.\n\n\"I...I like keeping a routine,\" Harvey responded, visibly uncomfortable. \"You remember, uh, Rufus? Used to workout same time as me, if I remember correctly.\" Harvey's reply was a forced chuckle, but his eyes were stormy and distant.\n\nThen Winston dropped a serious bombshell,  “You know, I spoke to Jake the other day. He tells me you told him Rufus had some dirt on you? Something about blackmail?” Harvey flinched at this mention leaving Winston confident that Jake’s words held a nugget of truth.\n\nWinston leaned against a workout machine, trying to keep the conversation relaxed. Though he served in outer space, Harvey seemed quite grounded to the fitness center. The astronaut in him always brought him back. It was part of their training, everyone knew that astronauts were masters of more than just astrophysics. Their physical training regime could put the best athletes to shame.\n\nIn the stream of fitness enthusiasts, Harvey was often an island, preferring to workout alone. Winston observed his familiarity with sharp objects from afar, courtesy of his astronaut training perhaps.\n\n\"Got a new combat routine, I see,\" Winston observed, pointing out Harvey's well-practiced form with a knife.\n\n\"Needed to practice, Detective,\" Harvey confirmed, showing Winston the knife. \"You never know when you might need it up there...in space.\"\n\nBringing up Rufus was like pressing a trigger. Harvey's face visibly lost color at Rufus' mention, his icy-controlled demeanor cracking slightly. \n\n\"Yeah, Rufus...\" He sighed, \"He had some stuff on me.. I mean rumor has it, but... he wouldn't do that to me, you know?\" As fatigue set into his voice, Winston noticed the distress behind Harvey's seemingly simple words. \n\nBarreling down, Winston remembered a casual tidbit he'd picked up recently. \"Hunting like your old man now, Harvey?\" \n\nHarvey hesitated before answering, \"Yeah, got my own now,\" he said, showcasing the knife again.\n\nAs Winston watched Harvey resume his solitary workout, the pieces of the puzzle slowly aligned in his mind. He wasn't there yet, but the investigation had certainly taken an interesting new twist. \n\n\"Keep in touch, Harvey,\" Winston called, leaving the man to his thoughts and his workout routine that seemed to be solitary for more reasons than one.\n\nDetective Winston surveyed the scene: a fitness center turned into a crime scene. Rufus, a regular client at the center, was the unfortunate victim. As he collected evidence, he recalled a pertinent detail: Rufus had a scheduled massage appointment on the day of his demise.\n\nWinston turned his attention to the masseur, Sergio. It struck him as peculiar that Sergio was relatively detached from his coworkers. He kept to his routine, arriving, completing his appointments, and leaving without mingling. \n\nSergio's professional commitment was admirable. His clientele had mentioned his silence during the sessions, focusing intently on his work. The private massage rooms, secluded and soundproof, added an extra degree of professionalism to his services.\n\nMoving past the massage room, he darted his gaze towards Rufus's wife, who stood to the side, nervously fiddling with her fingers. Winston remembered the rumors surrounding her. She had been allegedly lying about her whereabouts, a fact Rufus had confronted her about. \n\nWinston couldn't help but observe the notable chemistry between Sergio and her. They seemed to engage frequently, often spotted together, and spent seemingly endless hours alone despite Sergio's introvert nature. Her phone records held another quirk: Sergio's name appeared excessively.\n\nFinally, he strolled over to Sergio who stood silent and distant from the crowd. Even when spoken to, he was a man of few words. Winston had to admire the cryptic façade Sergio managed to maintain, never revealing any personal aspect of his life. \n\nA bell chimed, awakening Winston from his musings, indicating the end of an intense workout class nearby. Rufus had a standard fitness regimen, Winston mused, which Sergio was no doubt aware of. He found it fascinating how everything tied together somehow - the isolation, the silence, the silent communication. As he walked away, the heavy fitness center doors clicked shut behind him, sealing away the unsolved puzzle within.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Harvey\nB.

His gaze landed on Evelyn, her practiced fingers brushing over the rifles on display, particularly one that matched the murder weapon's description from the Malaysia case. He ambled over calmly, revealing his badge.\n\n\"Evelyn, mind if we chat?” He enquired.\n\nWith mild surprise playing on her face, Evelyn swiveled towards him. “Ah, Detective, how can I assist you today?”\n\nWinston, leaning on nonchalance billowed, “Just a small query. The sales records I stumbled on here mentioned that you recently purchased a rifle quite identical to the one involved in the Malaysia case.”\n\nEvelyn adroitly diverted, “Let’s not linger on such topics. How about a tarot reading instead? Or we could discuss hunting, I've been prowling the wilderness for decades. In fact, just the other day, I snagged a massive buck, a regular for me. Larger than any man I've encountered.”\n\nUnfazed by the segues, Winston steered back. “Last time you took a trip to Malaysia?”\n\nEvelyn’s countenance eased recalling her frequent visits. “Just last week, I made my usual jaunt to her chalet. Always adored that one, coveted a place just like it in the area. I suppose the keys she gave me showed her trust.”\n\nIgnoring her indirect admission to possessing the chalet keys, Winston pointedly continued. “Evelyn, I've heard whispers about your past in corrections. Is it true that you were under investigation for a suspected misconduct? I do remember reading files that mentioned questions raised by your superiors regarding your professional ethics during your tenure at the correctional facility.”\n\nEvelyn held her breath for a moment, eyes sparking with irritation, but deflected towards the familiar haven of her tarot readings. “Detective, ever contemplate the influence of fate? This morning, the Death card surfaced in my reading, symbolizing drastic change.”\n\nDetective Winston didn't dwell on her diversion. He pressed on, “So, it's confirmed then? Malaysia left you her chalet after her unfortunate demise?\"\n\n\"Yes,” Evelyn confirmed softly, nodding. “Yes, she did.\"\n\nAfter a brief silence, Winston added, “One more thing, I recall seeing your name in the investigation report at your job. It outlined allegations of misconduct against you and even raised questions about your professional ethics. Is that true?”\n\nBut before he could push further, Evelyn interjected swiftly, \"Who wants to ponder over the past? This tendency of mine to bring up tarot readings when questioned about my past career—it’s my distraction mechanism, Detective. The imminent future is what fascinates me.\" Spotting a chance, she jumped. \"Speaking of which, I heard you’ve again taken up hunting, Detective?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" Winston affirmed, adeptly bypassing her attempt to wrench away the conversation.\n\nEvelyn smiled, a small curl to her lips as her fingers lightly stroked the barrel of the recently purchased rifle, \"Good, keeps the senses sharp.\"\n\nDetective Winston was left to muse over Evelyn's diversions as he took his leave. His gaze involuntarily travelled to where Evelyn's fingers were tracing the rifle. Once a hunter, always a hunter—and in this round, it was hunting for answers to the Malaysia case.\n\nDusk was setting in as Detective Winston pulled up to the chalet. The picturesque scene was offset by the grim red crime scene tape adorning the front entrance. \"Ironic,\" Winston muttered as he absentmindedly flicked his thumb over a fingerprint report. The details confirmed the rifle found was indeed registered under Letti's name. As he scanned the report, he noted Letti’s previous acknowledgement that the rifle was kept in her home. He climbed out of the vehicle and stepped into the biting cold.\n\nIn the chalet, a collection of hunting memorabilia and photos gathered his attention. Winston found it chill-inducing as he thumbed through photos of Letti grinning, rifle in hand, next to her game. He placed the pictures back meticulously where they belonged and proceeded to dust for prints on the rifle held up by a mounted rack, his brow furrowed in thought.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. \"Detective Winston, we have Letti on the line,\" a young officer said, hesitantly.\n\n\"Thanks.\" Winston said, grabbing the receiver, \"Letti, can we talk about your activities on the night of the murder?\"\n\n\"Of course, detective. I spent the entire evening at home, watching TV,\" was Letti’s all too casual reply. \"But the night before, I stayed in the chalet, alone and hunting,” she added casually.\n\nOutside, Winston approached Letti's car. He silently took in the snow-encrusted vehicle, its presence at the chalet the night before the murder a fact that couldn’t be unseen. \n\nA notification beeped on his phone - an alert about Letti’s social media activity. A quick scroll revealed a series of disturbing posts filled with racist vitriol that Letti hadn’t even bothered to hide.\n\nLater that day, he interviewed people from Letti's neighborhood. A gentleman shared his disapproval of Letti's behavior at a recent public event: \"She publicly made offensive and racist comments, unprovoked!,\" he spat while shaking his head. Another testimony came from Malaysia's new boyfriend who claimed that Letti had approached him with hostile intent.\n\nIn the middle of his inquiries, Winston received a distressing message from a fellow officer. It was a tip that someone had reported Letti for an act of terrorism at the chalet. The exact same chalet where tonight’s murder occurred.\n\nWinston's mind ran back to the incident reported at the chalet. As he revisited the scene, he spotted a rifle case gathering dust, triggered by the memory of seeing Letti's registered firearm at the murder scene. \n\n\"Don't you go shooting every weekend Letti?\" Winston asked in a casual conversation.\n\n\"Yes detective, I find it therapeutic...\" Letti trailed off. \n\nWinston concluded the day by visiting one of Letti's friends who looked nervously at her hands as she said, “Letti was unusually upset about Malaysia's new relationship. She couldn’t quite hide it…”\n\nWinston nodded, \"Alright, thanks for coming in. We'll keep in touch.\"\n\nAs he got back in his car, he looked up at the rapidly darkening sky. Another puzzle piece found. Now, onto the next one.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Letti\nB.

There had been a commotion, then Ivy had dropped suddenly, spilling her drink. He noted Meredith, a familiar figure most Saturdays there. He took the time to reflect on the girl: she liked her soccer, tending to show up religiously for the weekend games. \n\nIvy, from the small bits of information he had, was someone that would frequent Meredith's shop. \"Meredith's,\" he pondered, \"it was quite a hotspot among the locals.\"\n\nWith this information in hand, Winston decided to pay a visit to Meredith at her coffee shop. Stepping inside, the bustling noise and smell of fresh coffee overwhelmed him. Meredith took her job seriously and always wore religious symbols, taking the time to pray before her shifts.\n\nAs he stood at the counter waiting for his usual, a loud bout of laughter broke out from a table nearby. For a split second, Winston saw an identical upset expression on Meredith. It reminded him of the CCTV footage he’d watched of Ivy laughing mercilessly.\n\nWinston broke the silence, \"I see Ivy used to come here often. She had a standing order I believe?\"\n\nMeredith was already preparing Winston's coffee. She glanced up, \"Yes, Ivy was a regular customer of mine. She always drank what I prepared for her without questioning it.\"\n\nThere was something that niggled at Winston as she said those words, but he brushed it off, deciding to dig into something that had been on his mind. \"I've heard you mixed drinks for Ivy sometimes, at the games?\"\n\nMeredith was nonchalant, \"Yeah, I've mixed drinks in the past. People never detect the taste.\"\n\nWinston acknowledged it with a nod as Meredith wrapped up their transaction, moving onto her next customer.\n\nBefore he left, he had one last question, \"How did you feel when you heard Ivy making fun of your religious beliefs?\"\n\nSomething flashed in Meredith’s eyes, \"Anyone who disrespects my religion deserves severe punishment. I believe it, Detective, even if it's not the popular opinion.\"\n\nWinston nodded, dropping a tip in her jar. It was clear there were layers to the barista and the spacious coffee shop that hinted at her prolific work. An array of different substances she uses for her drinks smiled back at him from the shelves behind the counter.\n\nAs he exited, his mind was full of information; Ivy's last moments at the match, the turn up of both ladies every Saturday, the relentless jibe of Ivy at Meredith's beliefs, and the latter's fierce defense of her faith. He patted his pocket recording device reassuringly - the interview was just the beginning.\n\nLooking at Ivy's lifeless body sprawled on the soccer field, Winston couldn't help but feel anger at the unforgiving world; but he had learned long ago that serving justice was his ultimate duty. Ivy was an enthusiastic attendee of local sports events, always with a drink in her hand to enjoy the game. \n\nJustice needed to be done, and his first suspect was Hugo. He had been working as the sound engineer for the soccer match. Hugo was seen leaving the match that day, his departure unnoticed in the hustle and bustle of the game, raising no alarms. \n\nWinston decided to explore Hugo's professional life further and visited the sound studio a few blocks away from the soccer field where Hugo worked. Hugo was known to work with chemicals daily while fine-tuning the sound mixing. A side gig for a sound engineer, Winston mused. \n\nHowever, a visit to Hugo's studio revealed something more interesting. Tucked away in a corner, he discovered Hugo's private office. Secluded, it offered an intimate setting where Hugo would often meet with people. Confidential files peeked through the piles on his cluttered desk, hinting at the private meetings happening in his office.\n\nDuring a conversation with one of Hugo's coworkers, Winston learned something intriguing. \"Yeah, Hugo's got a license for private investigation,\" he said, \"dunno why a sound engineer would need it, but yeah, he does.\" \n\nA particularly chilling fact that was the talk of the office was how Hugo also served drinks during the match...a bit unusual, even for a sound engineer. Unusual indeed, Winston thought to himself. \n\nDelving deeper into Hugo's background, it was revealed that he had taken a toxicology course in the past, a detail that raised a red flag in Winston's mind.\n\nHugo had a private office, a place to meet people, a shady license for private investigation, and knowledge of toxicology. All loose ends... that juggled around in his mind as Winston paved his way to finding Ivy's killer. Nonetheless, it was the responsibility of the reader to connect the dots. Winston left Hugo's office, clutching onto facts that needed to be put together to solve the mystery.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Meredith\nB.

The victim, Floyd, lay lifeless on the floor, an unlikely end to his ruthless pursuit of money. Floyd had refused to give up on collecting from Catherine, an airline pilot who had fallen on some hard times with missed mortgage payment after missed mortgage payment.\n\nStepping away from the crime scene, Winston called in a visit to Catherine. Her house felt quiet, almost sparse, a faint memory of better times perhaps reflected in something he noticed frequently in the past few weeks - her obsessively reading through her scrapbook, scanning, examining, dwelling in her past. It was hard to imagine a woman like Catherine having to sell her own plane, but interestingly enough, substantial debt and strain could cause people to do things they wouldn't ordinarily consider.\n\nAs Winston noticed Catherine walking up to the front door, an odd sight caught his eye. Catherine was holding her well-thumbed scrapbook in one hand, and newspaper clippings and obituaries littered the ground around her. A more careful look revealed an extensive collection of obituaries forming a large part of her scrapbook. The other hand held a familiar object – a pair of scissors – as she cut out pieces of articles to add to her collection. And discarded scrap clippings ferried by the breeze were scattered about. It was clear that the scrapbook activity was a frequent one. Task completed, she then tucked the scissors back into a bag that also concealed a shiv. Catherine felt a certain sense of comfort and preparedness when she had her shiv at hand. Her military background had made her adept at it, and she had never stopped carrying one, even after leaving the service.\n\n\"Catherine?\" Winston asked, subtly studying her.\n\n\"Yes, that's me,\" Catherine responded without trying to read into his intent.\n\n\"You were in the military, right?\"\n\n\"Correct. Piloting planes wasn't my start.\" She retorted, the scars of battles both physical and mental marked meditatively on her persona. Indeed, she was an unlikely debtor, having once been highly trained personnel in military combat – the shiv was her preferred weapon, which she'd practiced with consistently after her service days.\n\nWinston noticed the agitation in her eyes as they turned to the topic of Floyd. It was evident Floyd's continuous demand for money had stirred up enough frustration and desperation within Catherine, and the fact that he was planning to take legal action against her only added fuel to the fire.\n\n\"Well, Catherine. Nice talking to you,\" Winston said, standing up from the porch steps. \"This is routine, we're talking to everyone Floyd knew.\"\n\n\"Of course, detective. I understand,\" Catherine said, her rigid military bearing showing through.\n\nAs Winston drove away, he couldn't help but replay the entire conversation in his head. Flight or fight. In Catherine’s case, she was always prepared to do either, hence the shiv in her bag. With her financial situation forcing her into a corner, it seemed like fight was becoming her only option.\n\nWinston browsed through the case file while sipping his freshly brewed coffee. The victim, Floyd, was found dead in the library, dead from puncture and cut wounds, potentially from a shiv- an easy enough weapon to make or find.\n\nHe sat back in his chair, looking over the CCTV footage from the library. The video stream showed Zara, a local fashion designer known for her extravagant style and equally extravagant temper, walking in and out of the library on the day of the crime. That wouldn't normally place her as a suspect... if it hadn't been for the fact that Floyd and Zara didn't exactly get along.\n\nFloyd had told friends on numerous occasions how Zara had asked him for money, a request he'd always refused. Winston flicked through more notes - Zara had been spending a frightening amount of money on drugs, and her erratic behavior had seen her lose more than one important contract. \n\nHe clicked his pen thoughtfully. Zara was well-known for her intricate designs and elaborate fabric work, often using scissors and needles, objects commonly found in her toolkit. It didn't take a seasoned detective to figure out that, with enough motivation, any of these objects could be easily reshaped into a makeshift weapon. \n\nWinston took another sip of his coffee, rubbing his temples. He looked again at the CCTV recording of Zara. She seemed on edge, showing the typical nervous energy of someone under the influence of drugs. He remembered Zara from a case a year ago- a dispute with a rival designer. She had improved her status in the fashion industry immensely since then, but her life clearly had a negative twist.\n\nThe library had been filled with people the day Floyd was murdered. Zara, on five separate occasions, was caught on the CCTV entering and exiting the library. Floyd was no different, he also spent a majority of his day there, lost between the shelves of literature. Winston thought back to his initial conversation with his colleagues about the case: something didn't feel right.\n\n\"You said Zara often works with sharp tools, right?\" Winston asked the officer taking notes. \n\n\"Yes, scissors, needles... she says they give her the precision she needs for her work.\" The officer replied, looking up from her notepad. \n\nWinston knew he had a long day of investigating ahead. With one last glance at the CCTV footage, he left his office prepared to find the truth.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Zara\nB.

The murder weapon? An unlikely and gruesome choice, a flamethrower.\n\n\nWinston stepped out of his nondescript sedan and glanced up at the neon sign of the motel, a place whose exact location was confirmed to him by Gregory. One of the letters was flickering intermittently, giving the place an eerie ambiance. He took a deep breath and made his way towards the motel bar.\n\n\"Gregory?\" He asked, ducking his head into the empty bar and spotting a lone figure sitting at the counter, the man who was spotted near this very bar on the night of the murder.\n\n\"That's me,\" came the gruff response.\n\nMurmuring a hello, Winston took a seat beside Gregory, a stern-looking man who held himself with a strict discipline and a military demeanor. Winston couldn't help but notice the various pins and medals pinned to Gregory's jacket- the mark of an avid military memorabilia collector, especially flamethrowers which he had learned to use during his time in the military, just like many other veterans he had met.\n\n\"I see you keep up with the military standards, Gregory,\" Winston observed, subtly glancing at the pins before turning his attention back to Gregory, \"Collecting memorabilia from your time, especially those flamethrowers you trained with?\"\n\n\"Yeah, something like that,\" Gregory muttered, his gaze still fixed on his untouched drink.\n\n\"Can I assume your flamethrower gets a lot of attention in your maintenance routine? They're not easy to keep prim and proper,\" Winston asked casually.\n\n\"Yes, it does, but it's long been decommissioned, just for display,\" Gregory affirmed.\n\n\"Adam mentioned he was staying at this very motel,\" Winston prompted subtly.\n\nGregory nodded, \"Yeah, he told me.\"\n\n\"Looks like you're familiar with this place,\" Winston stated, looking around the bar, \"Heard you were here last night as well.\"\n\n\"Couldn't sleep, I always feel restless unless I have a task to accomplish. Decided to take a walk,\" Gregory shrugged, his gaze briefly meeting Winston's before returning to his drink, \"What does it matter?\"\n\nWinston chose not to answer, instead he moved onto the next question, \"You often stay up late, a norm from the military days?\"\n\nGregory grunted in affirmation, \"You could say that.\"\n\nA silence fell over the two, only broken by the distant hum of the flickering motel sign. Winston broke the silence again, \"Also, can't help but notice that you prefer being on your own. Must be hard on the social life?\"\n\n\"Helps me sleep,\" Gregory muttered, a hint of annoyance creeping into his voice, \"What does any of this have to do with anything?\"\n\nWinston watched as the veteran steadily stood up, avoiding any further conversation. As he watched Gregory stalk out of the bar, his mind already weaving together the facts. It was time to return to the precinct and put together the pieces of this perplexing puzzle.\n\nAfter another long day of investigations and paperwork, Winston, a seasoned detective with the local police department, sat at his desk with a cold coffee in his hands. He still had to visit the motel, the crime scene, but before that, he wanted to talk to Alfred.\n\nHe arrived at a local gym and found Alfred busy in his weight training session. He had a muscular built and was sweating profusely. The weightlifter greeted Winston, “How can I help you, detective?”\n\n“I need to talk about your friend Adam,” Winston said. “Would you mind taking a break?”\n\n“During the tournament? Nope. I can talk and lift,” Alfred replied, demonstrating his multi-tasking ability. \n\n“You two were close, right?” Winston began, Alfred nodded in confirmation. \"Adam made a comment. He said you confided in him about a scandal that could have knocked you off your pedestal, any idea about it?” Alfred stopped after Winston's question remained on him. He shrugged and resumed his session, “Just a gossip. Adam was known for his love to spread rumors.”\n\nWinston let the topic slide, “He mentioned it was held at the motel where you guys frequently have your team meetings.”\n\n“Yes, the manager gives us a nice discount. Plus, it’s close to where the tournaments happen. In fact, we're holding today's tournament on-site in the motel conference hall,\" Alfred said, struggling with the weights in his hand.\n\nWinston noticed a suspiciously large tool bag near the training apparatus. It was slightly open and he could see a hint of a flamethrower poking out. Alfred's tool bag.\n\n“And this,” Winston moved a point towards the bag, “mind if I take a look? I need to call it in for processing.”\n\n“Not at all,” Alfred shrugged again, breaking from his training, “It’s the equipment I use for my event. I see that keychain on your belt, same as mine, the key to Adam's motel room. Got it when he entrusted some his valuables to me.”\n\nWinston nodded, quickly making the connection as Alfred was a professional athlete famously known for his flamethrower stunts.\n\n“Adam had the key to your motel room. May I ask why?”\n\nBefore Alfred could respond, his phone rang. “My agent,” he said, answering the call and walking away.\n\n“Surely, that’s Alfred you are talking about. The one who is close to signing a multimillion-dollar endorsement deal?” Winston overheard the agent say.\n\nWinston decided to take his leave with more questions than answered. He shook his head and walked away, ready to work on more leads. Today had given him much to ponder, he had more information to unravel the secret that Alfred wanted to keep hidden and Adam couldn’t.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The Sands children were playing without Marjorie, their experienced nanny, conspicuously absent; the absence was unusual since Marjorie was well known for dicing up apples for the children to snack with her hunting knife. She had not taken the children for their usual afternoon jaunt to Times Square that day. Winston felt an unusual pit in his stomach.\n\nHe decided to confront Marjorie at the Sands' new triplex in Times Square. He passed by a bodega, the small television in the corner flickered - CCTV footage showcased a figure that could only be Marjorie, strolling through Times Square at the suspected time of the murder. She lived close, only a block away.\n\nAt the Sands' triplex, a crucial evidence was left untouched in the trash can. A letter, from Ana to Marjorie, lay crumpled bearing a sordid secret, Ana knew about Marjorie's fabricated immigration status. The letter bore Ana's threats too, stating clearly her intention to report Marjorie to the authorities.\n\nAs Winston was scanning about, Marjorie opened her door to him. On the kitchen counter, he noticed stacks of fruits and an empty knife holder. Winston specifically remembered seeing her just the other day at the local general store, purchasing a hunting knife identical to the one used in the murder, for her daily fruit preparation routine. Curiously, the knife was missing. Timing of things did feel odd, given her employer's recollection of Marjorie sharpening a knife that very morning. \n\nHe questioned Marjorie, \"Why would you leave the children in Times Square by themselves?\". Marjorie murmured a shaky defense, \"They are grown enough to look after themselves\". Time and again they used to visit Times Square, an easy walking distance from the triplex, so Winston knew her excuse was not completely unfounded, but today he wasn't buying it.\n\nAs Winston left the triplex, his mind was hounded by continuous streams of 'what ifs'. All he could remember was the nervous countenance of Marjorie, in the view of a CCTV footage. She was seen leaving her employer's home at the exact time when Ana had warned about blowing her secret to the authorities. Her sudden nervousness and the hasty outing to Times Square without the nanny, all fell into an ominous sync, a sync he'd rather not confirm.\n\nDetective Winston shuffled through his papers, casting his gaze over the case notes related to Ana's murder. He sighed, glancing out the window to the bustling city of Time Square below. \n\nThe place of interest? One unassuming vendor stand amongst the neon chaos that seemingly never switched off, a spectacle unto itself. This is where Cecilia spent all her days, standing by her table piled with knick-knacks, everything from flashy sunglasses to novelty t-shirts. On the floor beneath her overflowing table were stacks of books, each one a testament to her visits to the neighboring bookstore; Cecilia kept every book she bought, never lending or losing a single one.\n\n\"Looks like this time, even Time Square couldn't quite keep its darkest secrets hidden,\" Winston muttered to himself, contemplating the murder that had unfolded in Time Square during the bustling evening hours.\n\nThere was an alley near the bookstore, and Winston settled himself in the shadows, lighting up a smoke, waiting. As dusk ebbed into the square, Winston spotted Cecilia helping herself with a fresh book from the crime section of the bookstore. Winston found it intriguing; her peculiar fascination with crime seemed unsettling amongst her chats with her fellow street sellers. \n\nBy the time Winston approached her stand, the crowds had thinned, and she had already packed up for the day. She was an impressive storyteller, weaving cautionary tales of infamous killers she had read about from her newly acquired books. As the story progressed, he spotted the glint of apprehension from a few fellow vendors. \n\n\"Ana sure had an inquisitive spirit, didn't she?\" Winston inquired casually, watching Cecilia carefully. \n\nFaces lost in an ocean of bustling bodies, Cecilia recalled noticing Ana with a pointed curiosity towards her stand. With her camera, Ana had been a constant presence, focused on the trinkets sold and the vendor before her.\n\nAna had been snooping around, asking about legal vendor requirements. Cecilia, confused initially, shrugged it off as Ana's nosy nature. A tale of odd events unfurled as Cecilia recollected finding a message on Ana's forgotten phone, an anonymous tip to the police. \n\nA rush of tailored suits and impatient tourists occurred, even at these late hours on the square, as the mystery unraveled. Winston returned himself to the chaos of Time Square, leaving Cecilia to her own evening ritual. The curious, seemingly benign vendor with her penchant for crime lore and engaging storytelling was but one corner piece in the grand puzzle of Ana's untimely death.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

There, pinned up in a chaotic array of incident reports, photographs, and clipped newspaper articles, was the ever-growing puzzle that was Stuart's life - and brutal death.\n\nStuart was no saint. A frequent visitor of weekly wrestling matches, he was well-known for his affinity for the ring's harsh lights and the electrifying atmosphere. He wasn't just a wrestling fan. Stuart was a former drug runner, who narrowly escaped the long arm of the law. He gave up drug smuggling after his last run-in with the cops; a move that caused a few raised eyebrows among his associates.\n\nWinston swiveled back to his desk and picked up Octavia's prison file. Octavia was no saint either. Despite being behind bars, she was a constant thorn in the prison warden's strict regimen. She was seen trying to steal drugs from the medical ward just last month, and was found alone in her cell during Stuart's murder. The lack of commotion in the prison that day as recorded by their intensive CCTV coverage was highly suspect. \n\nThe detective further examined the prisoner's file, scrutinizing the day-release pass she received for the wrestling event. The warden's signature was clearly visible on the pass. Evidently, Octavia was granted a rare liberty; she was allowed to join one of the wrestling matches - the same event where Stuart was found lifeless.\n\nHowever, there was no apparent reason why Octavia would want drugs. She had no history of fancying them recreationally, and the prison file showed no signs of any mental illnesses that might have explained her erratic behavior. But it was clear as day that she was in constant turmoil without drugs. The file also covered various incidents where her withdrawal symptoms were reported.\n\nWinston sighed as he put down Octavia's file, rubbing his temples wearily. The case was a complicated one, filled with numerous possible explanations, but no definite answers. He needed a good night's rest; tomorrow was another day of work. So, he turned off the desk lamp and disappeared into the darkness of the night.\n\nWinston lounged back in his old leather chair, scanning the sparse details about the victim, Stuart. Another death in the wrestling ring, another round of evidence to collect and people to interrogate. The lead pipe responsible for Stuart's demise remained at the forefront of Winston's thoughts. But this investigation was unique. His present interviewee, a staunchly religious man by the name of Shawn, was not just any ordinary spectator.\n\nShawn was known by many in the community. A Theologian of some hard-core sect of Christianity, he was often seen after wrestling matches, conducting sermons in the ring and preaching to his followers or buried in books. On the night of the murder, he was no different. Winston found Shawn at the church, where he had returned to refine the sermon he had delivered after the match that fateful night.\n\n\"I understand that you conducted a sermon at the wrestling ring just around the time of Stuart's death,\" Winston began.\n\nShawn's eyes glinted with sadness as he responded, \"Yes, that's correct. Stuart had even attended these after-match sermons sometimes. He was going through some tough times and often confided in me.\" \n\n\"And you were there post-match, conducting the sermon when it all happened?\" asked Winston. \"Well, wrestling matches usually wrap up late, so my sermon would have been around the approximate time of...you know,\" Shawn trailed off, unable to speak about the tragedy.\n\nRest of the story remains the same.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

They depicted the daily life of a woman maintaining an intense physical regimen. She was fit, she was disciplined. A disciplined, successful wrestler.\n\nThe sun faded into the horizon as he stared at the record of the wrestling event Octavia had been part of and for which she had been granted a day-release pass. The sign-off from the warden stood out even in the dimming twilight. In Winston's years of experience, it was a rare thing for a prisoner to be given such a privilege, but to wrestle? That was unheard of.\n\nOctavia, however, was an exception. She reportedly kept up her wrestling training in prison, rigorously keeping in shape. This explained her winning streak in the prison's wrestling records. But it didn't explain everything.\n\nA chill wind swept through the yard and Winston flipped a page, his eyes catching on a note about Octavia's disciplinary actions. Several infractions, including her use of illegal foreign objects in wrestling matches, her attacks on other inmates – even using a tray as a weapon once – were duly noted.\n\nIt was the mention of her being caught as she attempted to steal from the prison’s medical ward though, that drew Winston's attention back. This was a woman fighting, desperate even, against the grips of drug addiction. Withdrawal symptoms were known to be brutal, but rarely did prisoners resort to such extreme measures.\n\nMoving next to Stuart's file, it was clear his troubles began long before his death. Notorious from his time smuggling drugs, he later succumbed to the law's pressure and put a stop to his operations. It was a known fact he later became a regular at wrestling events, noticing Octavia there more than once. A rehabilitation, or an escape, who could tell?\n\nWhether his love for wrestling drew him into proximity with Octavia, or his previous life of drug-running played a part, was unclear. But while drug addiction had inflamed Octavia’s desire for the substances Stuart had dealt in his past, she too shared a passion for the wrestling spectacles for which he was known. Their paths certainly crossed more than once on wrestling's squared circle.\n\nAs Winston compiled his notes, having immersed himself in the life histories of both Stuart and Octavia, he felt a strange connection between them. The pieces were there. Now, he just had to fit them together into a telling tale of how this wrestling ring turned into a crime scene, and transformed a fit, strong woman into a suspect.\n\nShawn's home was an impressive sight, and the library even more so. Winston noticed it immediately upon walking in, walls nearly toppling over with books. A slight air of dust hung in the quiet, still air of the room. Some of the book spines jumped out at him - collections of works on serial killers - but he reminded himself to stay focused on his task at hand.\n\n\"Detective Winston,\" Shawn greeted him, rising on his entry, \"Please have a seat.\" \n\n\"Thank you, Shawn,\" Winston complied, glancing about the room. “Impressive library. Do a lot of your work in here?” \n\nShawn nodded, gesturing around the room, \"Yes, my sermons take a lot out of me, and preparation requires time. I often seclude myself in my study, preparing for my sermons. My faith is the core of my being, detective.” \n\nWinston nodded, listening to Shawn talk proudly about his devotion to his faith. He did not interrupt when Shawn spoke of his religious rituals involving lead pipes that he had been taught by elders of his faith. \n\nShawn leaned back in his armchair, wiping a bead of sweat from his forehead, \"In fact, detective, on the night of the incident, I was conducting a sermon for our group, right here in my home study, followed by our ritual at the wrestling field. Stuart solicited my presence to view the wrestling match and then to conduct the closing rituals.\"\n\n\"And how do you normally feel after these rituals? You look a bit tired, Shawn,\" Winston softly asked.\n\nShawn rubbed his eyes and sighed, \"Studying and my religious work often tire me. It's a lot of late nights, yes...\"\n\nWinston nodded and stood up to leave, \"I appreciate you taking the time to chat with me, Shawn. I'm sorry for your loss.\" \n\nShawn thanked him and Winston left, noting the enclosing quiet of the study once more before he did. The library lingered in his mind, but he shut that thought away as he walked out of the house.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Shawn\nB.

Following the cordoned path, the flash of evidence markers catching his eyes, he ran his fingers around the sai in his hand. It was of a unique make, identical to the style used in Freya's martial arts training and not commonly found. There were not many who could handle such a unique weapon, fewer still who owned them.\n\nThe path led him to Freya's home later that day. He was introduced into a crisp and clean living room, save for an empty slot in a display case filled with a fascinating collection of sais. He pondered silently, looking at the missing gap, like a puzzle awaiting to be solved, surely it must have been an important sai to her.\n\nOff the bat, Freya seemed uncomfortable as she started nervously, \"It's good to see you detective, I’m sure you've heard from my friends, they stopped by and I expressed to them my concerns about Jess threating to disclose my secrets. They comforted me, assuring me they would speak to her.”\n\nSeeing that Freya seemed distressed, Winston decided to breach the topic divertedly, “Freya, I notice one is missing. Care to tell about it?”\n\nWith a hesitant nod, Freya spoke, “It recently went missing. The one missing held a sentimental value to me, Detective.”\n\n\"Picked up any replacements?\" He asked. “Any practicing recently?”\n\n\"Well, I was at my dojo last week for training,\" Freya offered.\n\nAn interesting tidbit given the recent events. He was drawn by a peculiar object on a side table. A phone, separate from the one Freya had nervously returned to her pocket.\n\n“This your personal phone, Freya?” Winston asked.\n\nFreya’s cheeks reddened, and she quickly replied, “That's my private phone, detective. I find it easier to keep my personal lines separated from the world.” The device was quickly turned off, secure under her watchful gaze.\n\nThroughout the conversation, she seemed uncomfortable whenever he moved too close to anything personal, quickly steering to another topic. Noted, Winston thought, but he was yet to bring up anything about Jess.\n\n“Freya, let me cut to the chase. Jess was found to have written a letter to the local paper about exposing someone's dark secrets. We found a large payment from you to a private investigator. Want to tell me something?\"\n\nShe seemed aghast. \"Detective, Jess had been saying for a while that she had something on me that could ruin me. But we all have our secrets, don’t we? I hired someone to figure out what she had, it was all in my defense!”\n\nWinston took a moment to consider her words. She was a charming woman, but he was trained to look past faces. \"It's good to be honest, Freya,\" he added quietly, placing the sai back in the evidence bag and heading for the door. \n\nOnce back in his car, he noted how stalwartly Freya switched off her private phone when he was around, an action that made him ponder as he started his vehicle to return to base.\n\nWinston had never been a huge fan of pop music, he preferred jazz. Nevertheless, he found himself standing next to a stage that had, the previous night, been vibrating with the sound waves of Leona's music. Leona, a young singer with a dazzling voice that had jetted her to national stardom. Now, just twenty-four hours after her astonishing concert, she was being questioned by Winston, a detective, about the horrific discovery that morning of Jess' lifeless body beside the neighboring swamp.\n\nHe found Leona backstage, looking distraught.\n\n\"Your concert last night,\" Winston spoke patiently. \"The venue was right next to the swamp, am I correct?”\n\nLeona, with her tear-stained mascara, nodded. \"Yes, detective. It was.\"\n\n\"And you had Jess present? Jess with the VIP pass?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Leona replied, her usually confident voice reduced to a mere whisper. \"She even met my sister after the show.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston muttered, trying to keep his tone neutral. \"Because I had a report that she was seen arguing with your sister. She seemed rather threatened.\"\n\nLeona's face was a mask of sadness as she recalled the event. \"My sister? Threatened? I...I saw it happen, she looked scared during their confrontation. Later, Jess also sent a threatening message to my sister after that confrontation. It really upset her and she's been in a distressed state since then.\"\n\nNoticing the grim determination on Leona's face as her thoughts drifted to her sister, Winston probed further. \"I heard you're protective of her,\" he added, watching Leona's reaction.\n\nVisibly shaken, Leona admitted, \"I always have been.\" She dabbed at her eyes with a tissue. \"We only have each other. That's why I didn't object when she wanted to come to my martial arts classes.\"\n\n\"Ah, your martial arts classes,\" Winston interjected. \"I have on my record here that you've been seen attending those regularly over the past months.\"\n\nLeona looked surprised. \"Yes, detective. I needed a way to vent out my stress, and I found martial arts comforting.\"\n\n\"Martial arts, hmm?\" Winston mused aloud. \"Your instructor even mentioned that you've been progressing quite well and he admires your skill with certain weapons. Have you ever handled a sai?\"\n\nFear was written clear on Leona's face as she quietly nodded, understanding where this conversation might be leading to. \"Yes, I have. I just purchased a set and have been training with them. They stay in the dojo, though. I swear.”\n\nLittle did Leona know, but her confession perfectly fit the narrative Winston was trying to weave. He gave nothing away with his stoic expression.\n\n\"I heard,\" he continued slowly, \"that after the concert, Jess was seen headed towards the swamp.\"\n\nShe nodded her head, \"Yeah, people sometimes take that route to avoid the traffic...\"\n\nThe conversation ended, and Winston didn’t probe further. As far as Detective Winston was concerned, he had all the information he needed. He had many clues to ponder over and a murder investigation to lead. The image of the sai next to Jess's body in the swamp was quick to return as he went back to his car.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Leona\nB.

The crime scene photographs laid out on his desk seemed far-fetched, yet chillingly real. The circumstances were more Hollywood than real life; a body on a plane and a shotgun involved. The wedding party, including Keira and Angela, had travelled together to the destination for the wedding. \n\nAs he took a sip of his lukewarm coffee, he forced down the bitter taste, and turned his attention to the suspect in question; Angela, the Maid of Honor. Apparently, she had been quite the participant in Keira’s wedding party; even had the responsibility for the suitcases.\n\nKeira's life seemed to have ended prematurely, and one piece of information struck Winston immediately. Keira and Angela were reported to have had a fierce argument over Sam, Keira's boyfriend. From what he could gather, Angela had more than platonic feelings towards Sam. She had been spotted several times, gazing at him at the party with longing in her eyes. Furthermore, it seemed Angela knew a secret. Keira was planning to dump Sam after their trip, leaving him heartbroken. This argument about Sam and Angela's secret feelings towards him, seemed like a potential motive.\n\nAs Winston flipped through the case files, a detail about Angela's past caught his eye. She was an award-winning sharpshooter. Interesting. She also had a penchant for hunting... regularly. Another sip of coffee followed this revelation.\n\nAn initial testimony revealed that there had been no security checks for the suitcases and Angela was responsible for managing them. Was that a coincidence or a calculated move?\n\nAngela left the party late in the night and her departure seemed odd. What made it more unsettling was that shortly after Keira was last seen, Angela was sighted entering her house. Angela and Keira had been at the same party that night.\n\nHe swirled the last bit of his coffee in the paper cup. There were still many clues to decode and pieces to connect. Nonetheless, the facts were all laid out in front of him.\n\nHe finally exited his office, determined. Personal disagreement, unchecked suitcases, a late-night departure, and a secret crush... Winston knew he needed answers. The puzzle wasn’t complete. As he stepped into his car, he knew his next move - he had to interview Angela.\n\nWinston drummed his fingers on his notepad, waiting for Roy in the gritty staff room of the film set. In the room, a plethora of props scattered about - fake wigs, fake blood, all the tools of the trade for making movie magic look real. Among them, oddly enough, was a shotgun - a prop for one of the upcoming scenes.\n\nHe was here to interview Roy, a makeup artist by title, but wearing many hats in reality. Besides artfully painting faces, he handled the props and was even a certified gun handler, quite an unusual combination of skills, Winston thought not for the first time.\n\nFinally, Roy sauntered into the room, looking dishevelled but alert despite the insanely late hour. His eyes, through years of experience, immediately began to scrutinize Winston's face as if preparing to apply foundation and concealer.\n\nBefore his eyes could do his work, Winston began. \"Mr. Roy, could you explain a bit about your relationship with Ms. Keira?\"\n\nRoy's face muscle twitched noticeably at his question. Resisting the urge to highlight this, Winston continued.\n\n\"Were you two traveling together for the movie shoot?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Roy murmured. \"She was seated near me during the flight.\" Winston then chose to ease into a more delicate topic to officially address the rumor. \"The passengers reported seeing Keira being intimate with another man on the flight, a man who was not you. It created quite a commotion.\"\n\nRoy swallowed hard, \"I confronted her about it, of course. But she simply dismissed it as casual flirting, nothing more.\"\n\n\"I understand that it's a part of your job to handle the props in the films you work on, including firearms?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Roy sighed, his eyes wandering far beyond the confines of the room. \"There was this scene involving a fired shotgun in the movie we were working on.\"\n\nA ‘ding’ from Roy’s phone caught his attention. Winston noticed him unholstering his phone to view an incoming message, just like the day when Roy found explicit messages on Keira's phone that confirmed her infidelity. \n\nNoticing Roy’s quiet discomfort, Winston prodded further, “You were wide awake and idle the night Keira was murdered, weren't you?”\n\nRoy flickered a gaze at Winston but said nothing.\n\n\"It must have felt like a dream,\" Winston muttered, musing on his own thoughts rather than posing a question. \"To watch someone intimate with another man while ignoring your confrontations. It can make anyone lose composure. You were awake and not busy, is it because you were thinking about the scene you witnessed in the plane?\"\n\nRoy didn't answer, his hardened gaze holding Winston's. Whether it was for the detective to find or the truth to remain hidden, only time would tell as the conversation, like the investigation, carried on.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Virgil himself was standing in the front yard, admiring his Adonis-like physique in the car's reflective paint. His obscenely large biceps rippled as he flexed, each one larger than Winston's head. \n\n\"Winston, Detective Winston. Can we talk?\" Winston called out, causing Virgil to jump and spin around. Upon seeing Winston, a man of authority, Virgil noticeably tensed. His nostrils flaring, Virgil responded, \"Alright, Detective. What's this about?\" \n\nWinston watched as his gaze flicked back to the Ferrari and began, \"I believe you know Mackenzie? You were seen at her house the day she was killed.\" Virgil's eyes widened a fraction but he quickly composed himself. He admitted, \"Yes, I was there. She often asks me to move around some of her heavy furniture in her home office.\" \n\n\"I heard a rumor Mackenzie mocked your achievement in bodybuilding and eventually sold your trophy,\" Winston added. Virgil bristled at the mention of Mackenzie's name, a flicker of something passing over his face. \n\n\"Let's talk inside, feel more comfortable,\" Virgil said, leading Winston into his house. Virgil's house was immaculate. There was a separate room full of neatly categorized shelves crammed with documentaries and notebooks tagged with the names of the documentaries. The notebooks contained detailed diagrams, timelines and highlights of key events in the documentaries. It confirmed Winston's previous report that Virgil was quite into the True Crime genre. \n\nThe most surprising feature in his house was a giant glass case, empty and dust-free. It was obviously a place for something too valued to be manhandled. \"That empty spot used to be occupied by my bodybuilding trophy, an achievement that required countless hours in the gym and disciplined nutrition,\" Virgil said with a hard edge to his voice, \"then Mackenzie took it, belittled my effort and sold it.\"\n\nWinston's gaze flickered between the muscular man and the empty cabinet briefly before responding, \"A champion bodybuilder, impressive. I heard about your hardship and dedication. Shame about the trophy, though, they're hard to replace.\" Virgil's eyes blazed with something akin to anger but he made no comment.\n\nAs he was leaving, Winston briefly considered the muscle-bound man. Witnesses who had seen him at Mackenzie's house on the day of the incident... his collection of true crime documentaries... Mackenzie's mockery and theft of his prized bodybuilding trophy. The facts were like an incomplete jigsaw puzzle. \n\nA thick layer of fear hung in the cool evening air as Winston headed back to his nondescript sedan.  The connections were apparent, but the answers weren’t. And he still had a long night ahead.\n\nIn the secluded quiet of his office, Winston nursed his scotch as he pored over the case file for Sophia, the prolific art collector. His investigation took a deep dive into the CCTV footage from the home of Mackenzie, Sophia's benefactor. As he studied the video, he noticed Sophia, a recurring figure, found on the grainy footage both at the foot of a local dealer’s four-story warehouse and Mackenzie's home, the same dealer who supplied Mackenzie's esteemed art collection.\n\n“I’ve seen her around,” said Mackenzie’s neighbor on the shaky video clip, which Winston obtained from the CCTV mounted on Mackenzie's front porch. “She was here, at Mackenzie’s house. She comes by now and then to show off her new art pieces.”\n\nDuring his late-night surveillance, Winston had footage of Sophia transporting flamethrowers into her art studio, an arresting sight, but less so when considering her chosen artistic medium. As dawn broke over the city, Winston observed Sophia's art studio, pinpointing comings and goings. Indeed, Sophia was handling a flamethrower, a tool he learned was frequently featured in her work. Her signature piece was a charred wooden structure, only achievable through the extensive use of a flamethrower.\n\nContacting Mackenzie, Winston discovered her involvement in Sophia's struggle with substances. Mackenzie confessed to finding Sophia's hidden stash inside her own house during a visit from Sophia. This shocking revelation precipitated her intervention. Mackenzie threatened to sever the financial lifeline she provided for Sophia's art unless Sophia sought recovery. In fact, Mackenzie warned of public disgrace if Sophia didn't get help, wanting the world to know of her addiction unless cured.\n\nInside Sophia's studio, Winston found sculptures that contained charred elements, hues possible only by the flame's lick. He also discovered stacks of unpaid bills, a barren bank account ledger, and tell-tale drug paraphernalia. This grim scene painted a clear picture of Sophia's financial desperation and her fiendish need for drugs. Not only was her art unique but also for sale. Mackenzie was interested in buying a certain piece - Sophia had agreed to this transaction, as evidenced by Mackenzie's name tacked on one of the art pieces.\n\nSophia's living arrangements reflected her financial ruin. A note from Mackenzie, garishly displayed on her wall, hinted at the ultimatum over art funds unless Sophia cleaned up her act, a common maneuver in attempts at addiction intervention.\n\nIn the sanctuary of Mackenzie's home office, Winston unearthed documents revealing Mackenzie's heavy financial involvement in Sophia's life. Her contributions extended to Sophia's seemingly exorbitant rent, endless supply of canvases, paint, and even the shadowy corners of her addiction - her drugs. Mackenzie was more to Sophia than just a client, she was her de facto financier, the backbone to her irresponsible indulgence.\n\nWith this newfound perspective of the complexities of Sophia's life, Winston discovered evidence of newly discovered drug stash tucked away in an unassuming plastic bag marked with Sophia’s initials, found in Mackenzie's office. Sophia’s tangled web of deception began to unravel, but Winston remained composed. His mission was to discover and present the facts, navigating through the labyrinthine maze of lies.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Sophia\nB.

The name Lauren frequented his mind as he evaluated the circumstances of her death. It was a unique scene to say the least, a murder inside a labyrinth, with a nail gun as the murder weapon of choice.\n\nHis focus then diverted to the name that was on everyone's lips: Rose. She was Lauren's stepsister and her profession stood out to him the most. Rose was a carpenter; she was often required to read blueprints for her job, and had comprehensive knowledge about nail guns due to her regular use of them at work. As it happened, the blueprint of the labyrinth where the body was found was posted at her jobsite. An interesting coincidence, Winston thought, but he knew better than to jump to conclusions.\n\nRose's gang involvement made matters more complicated. As a member of a local gang that took their reputation seriously, she found herself enmeshed in scenarios where respect was the ultimate currency. Winston remembered hearing about a notorious gathering of the gang where Lauren had called Rose a loser. To publicly humiliate her in front of her fellow gang members like that had not been taken lightly. What bothered Winston was that despite Rose being present at a community event nearby, no one noticed her in the labyrinth that day.\n\nConviction settled within Winston. He needed to talk to Rose. Grabbing his coat, he exited the office, his mind reflecting the image of the carpenter, wrapped in the complexities of Lauren's murder. Little did he know, the clues were only beginning to unfold.\n\nDetective Winston put away the photos of the crime scene he was investigating. The labyrinth where Lauren was found, held a certain eerie mystique to it. He began by interviewing the suspect, Aubrey.\n\nWalking into the office of Aubrey was like walking into a different time period. The room was grand and ornate, filled with all types of frames and decor, managed by none other than Aubrey himself, the boss of the esteemed business.\n\nWinston started the conversation careful not to rush. \"You designed the labyrinth?\" he asked, nodding.\n\nA look of pride crossed Aubrey's face, \"Yes, indeed. I even supervised its construction.\"\n\nWinston casually inquired, \"And the labyrinth is part of the business property, I presume?\"\n\n\"Most definitely. It's a showcase, so to speak,\" Aubrey said.\n\nWinston continued the conversation but his attention was drawn by a box in a display case on Aubrey's desk. The box was labeled \"Keepsake\". \"What's in the box?\" he asked.\n\nAubrey looked slightly taken aback before he smiled, \"Oh, that. It's a lock of hair from someone who owed me. This person owed me and this is my keepsake,\" he admitted with an air of nonchalance.\n\nA brief silence followed. Breaking it, Winston continued, \"The labyrinth. Pretty difficult to navigate, I assume. Any blueprints or maps for it?\"\n\nAubrey half shook his head, \"The labyrinth is an enigma, detective, designed to challenge and confound. There are no public maps or blueprints for it.\"\n\nWinston couldn't help but notice a defaced picture in Aubrey's collection. It was a photo of a once close friend, the eyes had been scratched out thoroughly. \"What happened to the picture?\" Winston asked. \n\nAubrey didn't take a second to respond, \"A moment of rage. I was angry at betrayal by an old friend. I scratched the eyes out and after the argument, I put it back in there.\" \n\nLater on, Winston found out about a whispered overheard conversation Aubrey had about Lauren's betrayal as Aubrey was outside Lauren's house. Apparently, Aubrey had overheard a conversation between Lauren and a competitor. This lead to the argument and defacement of the photo.\n\nAfter the conversation with Aubrey, Winston got a hint towards Aubrey's character. Before he left, Winston asked, \"You have access to that labyrinth, correct?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" confirmed Aubrey, \"I have master keys to all parts of my property.\"\n\nIt was after Winston visited Lauren's residence that he found copies of confidential business documents clearly indicating her plans of betrayal. Lauren had planned to sell secrets to a known rival. \n\n\"This case,\" muttered Winston, \"is starting to look like a veritable labyrinth itself.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

One part of the testimony kept catching his attention - mentions of a determined older woman named Kimberly, who was infamous for confronting anyone speaking ill of her family name. She was adamant about preserving the family honor.\n\nWhile entertaining himself with these accounts, Winston decided to pay Kimberly a visit. He was greeted at the door by a stout woman with kind eyes, but a fierce air about her. Winston noted an impressive collection of amphibians, including a recent addition - an exotic poisonous frog. \n\nAs he settled into the visit, Winston noticed a stack of papers on her desk. They were research papers, filled with detailed analysis of the peculiar type of poisonous frog she recently added to her collection. Leafing through the papers, he found that they not only discussed extracting poison from the species but also elaborated on lethal doses. He had to hide his surprise.\n\nIn the ensuing conversation, Kimberly made it known that she would protect her family's reputation at any cost. \"Look, I would do anything it takes to maintain the good name of this family. You know, Jamal was planning on revealing a family secret? He should never have considered going public with it.\"\n\nThe words echoed in the room. Winston changed the subject, asking about the frogs. \"Ah, those are my beauties,\" Kimberly said excitedly as she introduced the new, rare addition to her frog family. \"I've done quite a bit of research on them, even studied how to extract the poison from the species.\"\n\nTheir mundane discussion continued, touching upon Kimberly's activities the day of the murder. \"I was enjoying my night at the casino,\" she admitted. \"I didn't feel like staying at home.\"\n\nNoting her ease, Winston casually asked about her relationship with Jamal. \n\nShe smiled warmly, \"Jamal was like another grandson to me, you know? I'd step in anyone's way if they tried to harm him. I’d do anything for him. By the way, would you like a drink, Detective? How about a gin and tonic, it was Jamal's favorite.\"\n\nSeeing no reason to decline, Winston nodded, watching as Kimberly left the room to prepare the drink. He cast another glance at the frog's enclosure and the stack of research papers on the desk. It would take some time to unravel the mystery behind Jamal's death.\n\nSitting in his criminally underlit office, Detective Winston pored over the case files for Jamal's murder. His brow furrowed at the cause of death - a lethal frog poison. The corners of his mouth twitched with a hint of moroseness and intrigue, as he thought of the exotic demise of a man so influential and with no known heirs or successors - except his goddaughter Lillian.\n\nWinston decided to pay Lillian, the goddaughter of the deceased, a visit. He remembered the name Lillian, an up-and-coming biologist specializing in amphibians, and now the apparent successor to Jamal's influential position — a coincidence too striking to ignore.\n\nOn arriving at Lillian's residence, he knocked and was greeted by Lillian's younger brother, who he had noticed earlier mentioned a strict 9 p.m. curfew enforced by their parents — a prospect seeming unusual considering Lillian's mature age.\n\n\"Detective Winston, how can I help you?\" Lillian's voice was calm. Winston, with practiced ease, began to ask the routine questions.\n\n\"I understand from your colleagues at the research facility that you have spent years studying the toxins of various rare frog species. That's remarkable.\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe amphibians are hugely underestimated in their biological significance,\" Lillian responded, an earnest enthusiasm glowing in her eyes.\n\nHer comment whisked Winston's thoughts back to the exotic murder weapon. \"Are there any of such poisonous species that you happen to own?\"\n\nA slight hitch in Lillian's demeanor suggested hesitation. \"Yes, I do own a rare species of frog known to produce lethal toxins.\"\n\nLeaning back and taking note of her demeanor, Winston changed the topic slightly. \"Did you know about the late-night visits Jamal used to pay to the casino?\"\n\n\"No, but I knew of his influence and power in the community,\" Lillian replied, her eyes distant as she pondered over memories of her late godfather. She further added, \"Jamal didn't have any other known successors and being his goddaughter, I've always desired to be as respected and influential as he was, and to even take his position one day.\"\n\nAs Winston prepared to leave, the local store owner from across the street approached him, offering a piece of information he hadn't considered.\n\n\"Saw Lillian over there popping out late for snacks,\" he mumbled; a detail that contradicted the household rule of strict curfew mentioned by Lillian's brother. It was backed up by another neighbor, who mentioned seeing Lillian sneaking out after dark on numerous occasions.\n\nIt appeared there was more to this goddaughter, this aspiring biologist, than met the eye. This next in line to Jamal's influence and authority, known herpetologist, owner of a lethal frog species– was she just an innocent bystander? Winston intended to find out.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Lillian\nB.

The victim, Josephine, was a bright young woman with an infectious grin who had recently started dating someone new. Winston sifted through a basket of witness statements, one of which detailing how Dale had been seen angrily yelling at Josephine after discovering her new relationship.\n\nHe mulled over the reports that had come in. Josephine's new lover, the wrathful confrontation with Dale, the police going through Dale's house and coming up with suspicious multiple driver's licenses, Dale's frequent presence at the victim's frequented café, and his predilection to appear wherever Josephine was.\n\nWinston shook his head slightly, trying to dissipish the fog of conclusions starting to form. Stacked in the pile of evidence was a slightly crumpled invitation that was reportedly handed by Josephine herself to Dale, inviting the latter to her house on the day of the murder, when no one else was at home according to her neighbors.\n\nRubbing his brow, Winston decided to pay Dale a visit.\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at him when Dale opened the door to his house was the cropped hair and roughened hands of an electrician at work.\n\n\"Dale,\" Winston greeted. \n\n\"Detective…\" The greeting was strained and curt.\n\nWinston decided to ignore it. \"Heard you had a little talk with Josephine recently,\" he started casually. \n\nDale tensed up a bit but didn’t deny it. \"We had a few words.\"\n\nWinston made a noncommittal noise. \"Seems you frequent the same café Josephine liked,\" he commented, carefully gauging Dale's reaction.\n\n\"Just like a good cup of Joe,\" Dale replied, his tense posture relaxing slightly. \n\nWinston noticed Dale hastily shove a few driver's licenses into his wallet. \"I also heard you lose your license often,\" he added.\n\nDale shrugged sheepishly. \"Never fails—always forgetting where I put those damn things.\"\n\nWinston noticed a particular license. \"All different names.\" \n\n\"It's a private joke,\" Dale defended hurriedly.\n\n\"Speaking of private matters, Josephine seemed to think quite highly of you. She asked you to her place I understand,\" Winston continued.\n\n\"That's true,\" Dale confirmed. \n\nWinston’s cop senses burned, but he showed nothing on his face. \"You were in town on the day she died, weren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Dale replied, \"I wasn't hiding.\"\n\n\"That makes sense,\" Winston replied. \"According to witnesses, they saw you leaving Josephine's house.\"\n\nDale glanced at him sharply. \"You're the detective. You tell me.\"  \n\nWinston tipped his hat cordially. \"Thank you for your time, Dale.\"\n\nWinston couldn't shake off the unsettled feeling as he looked at the crime scene photos one more time before heading out. But, despite his feelings, he knew he would have to dig deeper to reveal the truth. Only proof would suffice.\n\nWinston sat in his office poring over the case files once again. The victim was a woman named Josephine. She had recently joined the company where the main suspect, Letti worked. Josephine’s home had been blown to smithereens from an explosion while she was inside alone. Letti, an employee who often worked in Josephine’s home as part of her job was spotted in the area around the time of the explosion.\n\nHe rubbed his weary eyes, decision time. He hailed a taxi and headed to the company where Letti worked. The building was abuzz with activity as he walked in. Letti had left for the day, but her manager was more than happy to answer Winston’s questions. \n\n\"Letti? Yeah, she's been with us for a while. Started from scrap and climbed her way up,\" the manager began. \"Her duty to routinely work in Josephine's house due to her job profile indeed proves her dedication. Her engineering degree really gave her an edge, especially with the nitty-gritty of machinery.\"\n\n\"She was looking for a promotion, isn't she?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"You got that right, for a long time actually. A promotion would've helped her with her bills too. I heard she was struggling,\" the manager confessed.\n\n\"Ah, she was seen near Josephine’s house around the time of the explosion?\" Winston carefully watched for any reaction. The manager's surprise seemed genuine.\n\n\"That's odd. But, you know Josephine trusted her. Even gave her a key.\" Winston raised his eyebrow but said nothing, noting his reaction.\n\nThe next day, Winston got the chance to meet Letti for an informal conversation. She was smartly dressed and carried a professional air around her.\n\n\"I heard Josephine had just joined recently but was already being considered for the promotion,\" Winston began.\n\n\"Yes, she was. I must say I was a bit envious of her quick success,\" Letti admitted. \"Anyway, how can I help, detective?\"\n\n\"You work with chemicals daily due to the nature of your work at Josephine's house,\" Winston began. \n\n\"Well, detective, that's true. My role requires me to handle these substances not only at the company but more so when I am working at Josephine's house. Some even have the capacity to create a potent explosive if not handled correctly,\" she admitted looking cautiously at the detective.\n\nAs Winston left the building, he pondered over what he’d learned. Letti’s struggle for a promotion seemed plausible given her financial difficulties and Josephine was a direct threat to her. But would the envy drive her to kill Josephine and blow up her house? Only time would tell. His mind went back to the crime scene: Josephine alone, the explosion, Letti in the vicinity, and at her disposal, the lethal mix of chemicals from her daily work at Josephine's home.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

He had been working in his office all day in hopes of getting the dossiers in line for the odd murder by shotgun of Frances. His first hot lead was Meredith, a pet groomer in the heart of the rainforest. It was known that she would often hike through the rainforest for her business, gathering natural products for her grooming services.\n\nAs Winston approached Meredith's shop, it was evident Meredith had an odd passion for the rainforest. The shop was teeming with an assortment of animals, all appearing in need of grooming. She deftly moved from one pet to the other with a rhythm of ease. Her forearm bore a peculiar scar, dome shaped like weasel claws. Multiple scars scattered across her hand made a peculiar sight. When asked about them, Meredith replied, \"I have worked with many pets; they scratch and bite sometimes. As for most of these,\" she waved her scarred hand, \"I really can't remember exactly how I got each one.\"\n\nIntriguingly, Winston could not fail to notice a shotgun that seemed to have made its home in the corner. Noticing how swiftly she hid one of her scars underneath her sleeves, he knew she was a woman who was good at hiding truths. Informed by Meredith's neighbors who had seen a shotgun in her house multiple times, it was clear that she had a tendency to bring it to her pet grooming shop.\n\n“Meredith? I'm detective Winston. May I have a moment?” he asked as he walked towards her.\n\n“Sure detective, how can I help you?” replied Meredith, shooting him a cautious glance. \n\n“It's about Frances. Were you in the rainforest the day she was murdered?” Winston began, watching her closely.\n\n“Yes, I was. I can't avoid the rainforest, detective. That's where I do my hikes and collect the natural products I use for my grooming services,” she said, attempting to hide her uneasiness.\n\nWinston nodded, \"I see. Do you remember where you got that scar that looks like weasel claws?\" he pointed at her forearm.\n\n\"This?\" she rubbed her scar, \"Hmm..., it's hard to remember exactly, but this was from such a long time ago. A ferocious pet weasel mauled me rather badly once. It was quite nasty.\"\n\nWinston's eyes quickly glossed over the assortment of ribbons and trophies that were proudly displayed over the cash register.\n\n\"I see you've won quite a few shooting competitions, Meredith,\" Winston commented, a shadow playing upon his face.\n\n\"Well yes,\" she responded with noticeable discomfort, \"hunting was always more than just a hobby for me. I was a part of a hunting club.\"\n\nJust then, her cell phone rang and she excused herself. His eyes fell upon the shotgun resting against the wall of the shop once again. A moment later, Meredith returned, a steely expression on her face.\n\n“I was near the area Frances was murdered. It is the same path I use for my hikes. I recall it was around the same time,” she admitted. Her voice sounded steady, but Winston could sense the anxious undercurrent.\n\n“Thank you, Meredith. You've been helpful,” Winston nodded, though he had more questions forming in his mind waiting to be queried. There was something unsettling about Meredith's demeanor, her responses almost too guarded and calculated. But only time would reveal the hidden truths.\n\nFlicking away the ashes from his cigarette, Winston sauntered towards the edge of the forest. A path ahead of him led straight to the sight of the day’s tragedy. And just yards away, Frances’ lifeless form laid, crumpled under the towering umbra of the rainforest canopy. As he glanced around, old scents of the forest mingling with a distinct evidence of human presence caught his nose.\n\nPresent at the rainforest on the day of Frances’ murder were two individuals—Frances, the victim herself, and Kinsley, the enigmatic spiritual guru. Kinsley was reportedly seen leading her spiritual group towards the deepest part of the forest earlier that day and later, according to eyewitnesses, she and Frances were alone for a while, disappearing into the thick undergrowth of the rainforest. \n\nWinston wondered about the link between the two women—the one, freshly dead, and the other, a leading figure of a spiritual group already marred by a scandalous past of violent incidents involving firearms. These gun-related incidents had gained such notoriety, that law enforcement had started taking notice of Kinsley's group activities.\n\nKinsley had made no secret of the fact that she kept a shotgun for self-protection, even going as far as teaching the rest of her group the ins and outs of gun use during firearms training sessions. The shotgun retrieved from the murder scene was indeed registered to her, Winston had confirmed as much. Coincidence? He pondered, but quickly dismissed the thought. In his line of work, he didn’t believe in such things.\n\n“Doesn’t mean a thing though…” Winston mumbled to himself, stooping down to inspect the trampled foliage. She might’ve just left it behind in a hurry. But, the existence of the shotgun posed some troubling implications nonetheless.\n\nFrances was more than a random victim, making her murder all the more suspicious. Winston remembered receiving her detailed report, mapping out the unholy nexus between Kinsley's spiritual group, and the local gang. The woman had dedicated herself to bringing down the gang, working closely with local law enforcement to expose their shady deals. Coincidentally, Kinsley had recently gone on record, acknowledging connections between her group and the very same gang.\n\nTo make matters more intriguing, Kinsley's group had chosen to conduct their spiritual meeting in the rainforest on the very same day Frances was killed. Taking a final puff from his cigarette, Winston dropped it onto the ground, crushing it under his shoe. The murder scene was silent apart from the distant hum of wildlife. The twisted calculus of crime was about to unravel, with Kinsley at its epicenter.\n\n“I'll need to talk to Kinsley personally..” Winston voiced his next plan of action. Frances’ murder was a puzzle waiting to be pieced together, and every detail, every fact, was a valuable gem in Winston’s cache of information. And he had a feeling he was close to finding the answers. The day was still young, and he was just getting started.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Meredith\nB.

Isla, the beautiful young woman, was the star in almost every picture. Winston scanned every photo meticulously, but Brian, who had been a janitor for the family for many years, was nowhere to be found.\n\nHis attention was diverted from the photographs when the back door of the mortuary creaked open, and Brian stepped in hesitantly. He seemed self-conscious about his tardiness, his back hunched and his gaze darting around the room. Winston glanced over at the service in progress. Brian wasn’t mentioned as a friend or a relative during the service, but he stayed until the end of the burial, lingering as the crowd started to disperse. His aloof demeanor piqued Winston’s interest.\n\nThe next day found Winston scanning the tools in Brian's workspace. As per his janitorial duties, Brian handled an assortment of tools, the most common of which were lead pipes. His workspace deep in the jungle revealed that he had been working there for many years, in fact, over a decade, blending his job with nature, dirt, and rust.\n\nWinston remembered that a witness had seen Brian cleaning in the rainforest, a lead pipe in hand, on the same day Isla’s body was discovered. Brian was probably mending a burst pipe he had mentioned to Winston during a casual conversation. The rainforest, where Isla had been brutally murdered, was - oddly enough - a second home to Brian. Rainforest cleaning sounded strange to Winston but perhaps that was the way of life here.\n\nThe rainforest echoed with the sounds of both man-made and natural life around him. Winston watched the intricate work Brian was involved in. As the detective, he mused, \"So, I hear you've been here a while,\" while eyeing Brian maneuver a lead pipe he was using to fix a water valve.\n\n\"Yep, over a decade now,\" was Brian's gruff reply, his hands occupied. He paused to wipe his brow with a grimy arm. \"It's quite peaceful here, you know.\"\n\nWinston's gaze lingered on Brian before he divulged, \"You were spotted here around the same time Isla was murdered.\" Their eyes met for a moment before Winston disappeared back into the foliage.\n\nDetective Winston leaned against his cruiser, his eyes tracking the locals as they went about their daily lives. Faces lit up and heads turned as the rhythmic sound of drumming floated through the air. The source of this daily ritual was Jesse, a powerhouse drummer whose status in the town was akin to that of a local hero—a status enjoyed due to his immense talent on the drums.\n\nWinston watched Jesse for a moment longer, taking in the muscles that rippled in his arms as he played. His talent was undeniable, his every beat pounding out a rhythm that seemed to embody the heart of the community itself. He had spent countless hours practicing, strengthening his upper body and arms through his ceaseless devotion to drumming.\n\nBreaking away from the crowd, Winston took the path that led through the rainforest. Evidence suggested that Jesse visited this place often—where he drew inspiration from the symphony of nature itself and penned down melodies. It was known that his best works as a drummer were composed here. Wandering deeper into the rainforest, Winston couldn't help but try to see this place as Jesse might.\n\nA few days ago, Jesse had overheard Isla's nervous whispers about her intent to confess something incriminating to the police, something concerning Jesse himself. The knowledge threw him into a state of unease. Fearing what Isla might reveal about his involvement in illegal activities—activities she had discovered herself—had let the rhythm of Jesse's drumming take a harsher beat. \n\nAn association with a metalworking shop came up during the preliminary investigation.  This was the place where Jesse had learned to customize his drumsticks himself, favoring lead piping instead of the usual. It was a small token of uniqueness he added to his music but somehow felt out of sync with the rest.\n\nReturning to his cruiser, Winston pulled out a notepad, flipping to a blank page. Isla's name was written at the top, her connection to Jesse much more than casual. In her possession were the evidence of Jesse's illegal activities capable of damaging, if not entirely ruining Jesse's career and standing in the community.\n\nThe pounding of the drums echoed through the stillness of the rainforest, lending an ominous tone to the otherwise peaceful atmosphere. Jesse was aware of his imminent predicament—an inevitable reckoning with his secrets, aided by Isla's confessions.\n\nAnother day in the town ended, and with it, Jesse's drumming ceased. But for him, his day was far from over. His routine entailed hours of practice and composing, maintaining his superiority in the art. Jesse's skill was a result of his consistent hard work and dedication, his muscular prowess a testament to both.\n\nFor Detective Winston, Jesse was a suspect, committing a crime possibly to protect a secret shrouded by the rhythm of his drums. As he drove away, the murmuring of the locals filled his ears, talking excitedly about Jesse's session for the day. A crime in the community, a rhythm disrupted. The chapter that unfolded was far from melodious.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Jesse\nB.

The late-night echoes of thundering strikes and trash talks were now drowned by sirens and muffled conversations over secured radios. Winston paid no attention to the cacophony around him, his focus narrowed onto the sole thing out of place in a bowling alley—a pair of nunchaku.\n\nHe walked over to Mia, the waitress, a name and face familiar to many, a respected public figure among the regulars at the bowling alley.\n\n\"Late-night shifts, it looks like,\" Winston began conversationally, \"You often see a lot of the regulars, I suppose?”\n\nMia let out a sigh, suppressing a weary smile, \"Bowling is a religion for some, detective. Joel, for instance, he's nearly always here late-night, been observing him for quite some time.\"\n\n\"Like Joel?\" Winston probed further.\n\n\"Like Joel,” She echoed.\n\nAs a public figure, Mia was often under scrutiny. Despite this, she had always been closely seen with Joel at unusual hours, both witnessed in hushed conversations when Mia was off duty—nothing scandalous, just unusual as per the grapevine.\n\n\"Mia, may I ask about your recreational activities?\" Winston maneuvered the topic.\n\n\"I've been training in martial arts for quite some time, Detective,\" Mia responded without missing a beat. \"Nunchaku as well, it's one of the various arts they teach at my gym and I just happened to fall in love with it.\"\n\n\"Nunchaku?\" Winston asked, to which, Mia merely nodded. It was known among the locals that Mia often spent long, late nights practicing with her pair of Nunchaku at home, an acquired hobby, a passion honed in the confines of the martial arts gym she frequented.\n\nJoel was often at the bowling alley during Mia's night shifts. It wasn't unusual, but there was something that always seemed a little off about it. Mia, the waitress at the bowling alley, knew about Joel's regular late-night bowling habits. Perhaps due to this, Joel often ended up bowling late on the nights Mia was working.\n\nShe then recalled one unnerving evening—Joel explicitly threatening to unveil a potent political scandal that would surely taint her reputation if ever it reached the public. Shivers ran down her spine with the cold memory.\n\nAs Winston walked away, he took one last glance back at Mia. Her eyes looked like they were both emancipating and imprisoning secrets she would rather stay hidden. Winston knew his work was far from over.\n\nWinston scanned the crime scene photos of the late-night bowling alley murder for the umpteenth time, swiveling lazily in his office chair. Joel, the victim, had unfortunately found his end using a pair of nunchaku, a brutal, yet strangely eccentric way for a life to be taken - and that too after official business hours, an unusual occasion at the alley.\n\nHe downed the last of his coffee and grabbed his jacket, ready to conduct another careful suspect interview. He set out to find Rosemary, who had been working her overtime shift at the bowling alley when the murder occurred eerily during the late after hours.\n\nStepping into the buzzing local bar, candlelight bounced off the myriad of glass bottles lining the walls, all reachable only by ladders that the bartenders navigated with incredible balance. Rosemary, carting herself from the fridge to the counter, looked up at Winston as he approached. She looked perfectly graceful, a stark contrast to her claim of frequently bumping into things.\n\n\"Rosemary, I presume,\" Winston opened, his gaze lingering on her form, conspicuously clad in a long-sleeved shirt despite the warm ambient temperature.\n\n\"That's correct,\" she responded, her voice warm yet curt. As she reached for a bottle on a high shelf, she winced slightly. \"Got a stiff shoulder. Those martial arts gym workouts can be taxing sometimes,\" she casually mentioned, subtly revealing her regular gym sessions.\n\n\"I'm aware of your regular participation in nunchaku workshops at the local martial arts gym,\" Winston commented, given her previous statement. Rosemary chuckled, responding with a flex of her arms, clearly hinting at her muscular strength. Her attention moved toward a set of keys she was fiddle around with.\n\n\"Bowling alley keys. Part of the job,\" she explained before he had to ask, and then another conversation to make small talk deftly guided by the detective.\n\n\"Some nice nunchaku you have up there,\" Winston finally stated, nodding toward a martial-arts weapons display above the bar.\n\n\"Inherited,\" she said with a slight nod. \"Practiced a bit. It's art you know.\"\n\nBefore Winston could subtly inquire about her bowling alley shift on the night of the murder, another customer called her away. Yet, his observations continued as she navigated through the bar serving drinks - she moved flawlessly, despite her prior claim of clumsiness.\n\nLeaving the bar, Winston mulled over the information he gathered - Rosemary had worked at the bowling alley on the fateful night, she had keys to the place as part of her job, had trained in using and collected nunchaku, was a regular at the martial arts gym, and had inherited a collection of martial-arts weapons. All these shaped another puzzle for him to solve.\n\nWinston was no stranger to dealing with loose ends and carefully sifting fact from fiction. But even with the facts he gathered from Rosemary's interview, Joel's perpetrator was still elusive. The only certainty was the haunting image of the murder weapon, nunchaku, which were a significant part of Rosemary's life. The case was far from closed.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Rosemary\nB.

He was trying to absorb the details, trying to get a feel of the timeline. The footage showed Mark, a well-known local lawyer, clearly entering the mosque before the murder.\n\nMark was a regular attendee at the mosque for Friday prayers, and the timestamped security footage reinforced that this day was no different.\n\nWith a deep sigh, Winston packed up the monitor and made his way to the local store, where he'd arranged to meet with the store's clerks. He'd heard from the community that the quiet lawyer had been seen buying ammunition there.\n\nThe clerks confirmed it. Yes, Mark had been to the store to buy shotgun shells. It wasn’t out of place for Mark, known for his involvement with a myriad of firearm-related cases.\n\nAs Winston traveled back to his office, he reflected on the conversation he had earlier with Mark. The attorney was an influential figure in the community and often worked on cases involving firearm charges. His knowledge amassed from representing law enforcement personnel showed in his knowledgeable chatter about firearms. \n\nIn their conversation, Mark's fear was evident. It stemmed from Jamal, the victim, who openly expressed extremist beliefs to the community, causing unease. Mark was tasked with ensuring the safety of many community members, and they’d expressed their worries about Jamal to him clearly.\n\nUpon reaching his office, Winston began to piece together the case. He recalled at the time of the incident, Mark was present at the mosque, taking part in prayers along with the others. And Jamal… was Jamal afraid? Thought Winston. The following days would need more thorough investigation. With the data on his desk, the detective prepared himself to slowly trace his way through truth and deception in the days to come.\n\nWinston found himself parked outside the confines of a building overflowing with culture and history - a Mosque, that now is stained with the gruesome murder of Jamal. The wind threatened to dishevel his hair as he made his way inside, crossing paths with Gerald, a violinist who frequented the same religious establishment.\n\n\"Gerald, right?\" Winston called over the gusty winds, obtaining the attention of the musician.\n\n\"Yes, that's me.\" Gerald nodded, inspecting his violin case as though he could see through it to its contoured resident within.\n\n\"You were seen entering the Mosque at an interesting time by the security tapes, Gerald.\" Winston stated, keeping his gaze steady upon the man.\n\n\"Interesting time, detective?\" Gerald raised a questioning brow, \"I regularly come here for my prayers around this time.\"\n\nNodding, Winston eyed the violin case again, \"This—a hobby for you or profession?\"\n\n\"Profession. It consumes a lot of my time but I wouldn't trade it away for anything else,” Gerald responded, traces of pride crossing his features, as his fingers brushed lightly across the case. \"Keeps your fingers nimble, doesn't it?\" Winston asked casually.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Gerald responded, smiling softly, \"I suppose you could say they're suited to other delicate tasks too.\"\n\nWinston's gaze darted back to Gerald's face. \"Delicate tasks like...?\"\n\n\"Oh, anything that requires intricate finger movements I suppose.”\n\nThis was the first time in a long time anyone had invoked curiosity in Winston, a pleasant change amidst the tragedy. Before he could indulge in this observation, a glint from a computer screen in the corner caught his eye.\n\n“Is that public?” Winston inclined his head towards the computer.\n\n\"Why yes, Detective, it's open to all - centerpiece of this quaint little library corner,\" Gerald explained, before whispering in a reverential tone, \"It's perfect for uninterrupted reading.\"\n\n\"Reading anything interesting?\"\n\n\"Well, I have been immersing myself in the lives of some outstanding violinists who passed away recently. I find a kind of fascination in death, you know.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston simply responded, not daring to let a single emotion cross his face. \n\nCasually resting his hand on Gerald’s shoulder, Winston asked, “Gerald, do you by chance ever go to the shooting range?” \n\n“Funny you should ask,\" he answered casually, \"I just bought a shotgun last week.”\n\n“Well then,\" Winston said in a light tone, \"maybe I’ll see you around there.”\n\nWith that, he let Gerald get back to his life. Taking one last look around the Mosque, Winston exited the building, his mind already buzzing with the next steps of his investigation.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The victim, Troy, had been found dead in a shopping mall in one of the most unusual circumstances he'd seen: in a bear trap. It was a gruesome scene and one that didn't make much sense.\n\nConfused, Winston made his way to Clyde's auto repair shop. A greasy, dust-covered sign welcoming customers and a few older model cars dotted the yard. The mound of mechanical traps of all kinds added an eerie touch to the scene.\n\n\"Clyde,\" he asked, when a haggard man emerged wiping motor oil off of his hands.\n\n\"That's me.\" came the terse reply.\n\nWinston introduced himself and saw Clyde pause for a moment before shaking his hand. He told him that he wanted to know more about Troy, who according to the information he gathered, was a regular customer at Clyde's.\n\nAfter a sigh, he nodded, his gaze darkening. \"Yeah, Troy was a good customer. Always had car troubles. But he was into me pretty deep... owed me some dough for the work I had done.\"\n\nWinston then shared a piece of information that Clyde didn't seem privy to - Troy had been at the mall earlier in the day, just before his untimely death.\n\nIt was at this point Winston noticed a bear trap amongst the litter of mechanical devices. \"You work on those too?\" He gestured towards the trap, appearing casual.\n\nClyde glanced at the trap and nodded. \"Sometimes. For pest control and such. People bring them in, they're not workin' right, I fix 'em.\"\n\nClyde then went on about how he was on the brink of closing the shop due to his financial struggles. He needed to constantly upgrade his equipment but lacked the necessary funds to do so.\n\nIn fact, he too had been at the mall on the same day as Troy. \"I was there to buy new equipment for the shop,\" Clyde added.\n\nIt was interesting, Winston thought, given that Clyde's shop was practically a stone's throw away from the location of the murder. He made a mental note to follow-up on that.\n\nAs Winston thanked Clyde and turned to leave, he noticed a large sign hanging on the wall with the bold letters stating, \"We fix all traps – yes, even bear traps.\"\n\nWell, he thought to himself, that's a lot of loose ends to tie up. As he walked away, he felt the faint stirrings of a puzzle starting to form. He only hoped he could solve it in time.\n\nWinston, a seasoned police investigator, looked at the shop-till-you-drop nightmare known as a shopping mall - specifically the spot where Troy, a local political leader who proposed specific taxes impacting the horse racing industry, met his untimely demise. The weapon of choice still spun his mind, a bear trap... not something you find in an urban environment. \n\nHe had a long list of suspects, and mall security footage placed next on his interview list, a man named Alex, right there. Alex - a local jockey who runs a business seriously affected by recent economic stress and challenged by the policies and taxes Troy proposed. Alex had been struggling financially for several months, paying out more in expenses than he was earning. Winston had seen intriguing footage of Alex grooming Troy's hair at the gathering that night - an odd sight indeed. \n\nWinston caught the weary Alex, with visible signs of stress, as he was wrapping up his day at the local race track. A taxing industry was even further burdened by the policies Troy supported. They exchanged nods.\n\n\"How are you related to Troy?\" Winston asked, to initiate their conversation.\n\n\"I wasn't really close to him, but we knew each other from the horse race circles. Disagreements happen, everyone has their views,\" Alex answered ambiguously. \n\nLooking to probe further into one of his primary leads, Winston continued, \"What was your disagreement about exactly?\"\n\n\"Taxes... policies. Troy proposed this new set of taxes that hit right into my industry,\" Alex replied, visibly irked, \"You’re aware of the dwindling finances of the horse racing, aren't you? I have been paying out more than I have been earning for several months now.\"\n\nNext, Winston needed to verify some unusual behavior noted by others, \"I’ve heard that you have an unusual hobby. Is it true?”\n\nAlex seemed relieved at the change of subject, \"Oh yes, quite an unusual hobby; I collect bear traps.\" \n\n\"Quite an unusual hobby indeed,\" Winston echoed, playing it cool. \n\n\"After a tedious day at work, I stopped by the mall to shop for some, on the day of the incident,\" Alex casually mentioned. \n\n\"I see,\" Winston said, trying not to betray any emotion, already piecing together the facts from the mall security footage, the increased taxes, and the weird yet timely hobby. He made a note and prepared for his next interview.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Alex\nB.

Most of them bore information about Nathaniel's untimely demise in a local dance studio.\n\nNathaniel, an outgoing character with a dubious financial psyche, earned people's ire quite often. He apparently had it big for stealing shiny things. Of note was Clara’s valuable pearl necklace, which he was rumoured to be in possession of.\n\nWinston thought it was apt time to pay Clara a visit.\n\nNathaniel and Clara; cousins by parental lineage, contrasting dramatically by nature. While Clara was reserved, she carried a fervour for dancing. A known face at the dance studios. Heck, she was last seen near the studio just before the mishap unfolded. Winston pondered whether this was chance or circumstance.\n\nReaching her apartment, Winston knocked and Clara greeted him. He noticed a throwing dart board in the hallway with clusters of darts piercing the centre.\n\n“Fancy playing darts?” he asked casually.\n\n“My favourite pastime,” Clara replied, the faintest light dancing in her eyes. Winston gestured towards the bullseyes, “You're quite good then.” Clara just smiled in response.\n\nWinston recalled her reputation of playing dart games in the locale, consistently hitting bulls-eye.\n\nWinston changed the subject, \"Your cousin was rumoured to have your pearl necklace. Is that correct?\" Clara gave him a curt nod and recounted the time she caught Nathaniel sporting her missing necklace. \"I was outraged!\"\n\nA glint of vulnerability in Clara’s eyes didn’t escape Winston’s scrutiny.\n\nThe conversation veered towards charities, with a quick detour to a mention about her cousin, the hunter. She confided in Winston about a fraudulent charity she’d invested heavily in. She later found out Nathaniel operated the charity.\n\nWinston took this opportunity to broach the subject of her sighting at her cousin the hunter’s house on the murder day.\n\n“Indeed, I had to pick up a few things,” Clara replied candor in her voice.\n\nOn his way out, Winston stopped by the darts board. His gaze rested on the bullseyes and then fleetingly on an antique blowgun displayed above the nearby mantelpiece.\n\n“From the hunter’s collection?” he asked, veiling the touch of interest in his tone.\n\n“All part of the family,” Clara replied.\n\nAs he drove back, the facts played in his mind. Clara and her lost pearl necklace, her surprising accuracy with darts, her visit to the hunter’s house and her being in close vicinity of the dance studio where Nathaniel was found dead. He had a lot to think about.\n\nDetective Winston paced around his office, going over the information he had collected thus far on Nathaniel's peculiar death in the dance studio. His mind kept circling back to Homer, the victim's financial advisor, who owned an impressive collection of various hunting equipment that intriguingly enough, included multiple blowguns.\n\nNathaniel had found some suspicious discrepancies in his accounts and was bold enough to confront Homer about it. It didn't sit right with Winston. But again, his job was to look at facts, not reach conclusions.\n\nHomer was a perplexing personality. Winston remembered him asking about his dietary preferences during their first encounter. With a nonchalant shrug, Homer didn't have much to say about meat or vegetables. Not that it mattered half as much as the other facts on Winston's desk.\n\nHis trips to observe Homer didn't paint any brighter a picture. He'd seen Homer practice his blowgun skills. His neighbors had reported hearing nocturnal hunting noises from Homer's home. This didn't surprise Winston given Homer's past in the special forces, where he'd been trained to use such exotic weapons.\n\nBut practice was one thing, shopping quite another. Winston had had some surveillance on Homer and saw him, on one occasion, purchasing what looked astonishingly like a blowgun in a local hunting store.\n\nThere were also those mysterious letters. They'd been signed off anonymously but were traced back to Nathaniel. The letters were cloyingly demanding, asking for large sums of money. Homer refused to elaborate on them, much as he hadn't provided any reasoning for the financial discrepancies Nathaniel had discovered.\n\nWinston let out a sigh, pushing his glasses up on his nose. He'd been through all the information, and he couldn't shake off the nagging feeling that he needed to look deeper. But again, that wasn't his call to make. He'd leave it up to others to decide if Homer was just an eccentric hunter or whether the venom was from his blowgun. His job here was done.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Homer\nB.

Torn between deciphering the eerie stills of labyrinth camera footage and diverting his attention to a potential suspect far too close at hand, he had seen a familiar sequence unfold before him.\n\nOn the footage captured by a security camera in the building, he had seen the tenant, Rachel, entering her apartment with the missing man, Samuel. The complicated storyline was becoming more obvious – a pattern that Winston had seen far too many times with Rachel. According to the information gathered so far, hers was the last face he saw.\n\nHe knocked on the door of Rachel's apartment, a new tenant he'd been informed had only been living there for about a week. Winston couldn't help but take note of the moving boxes still stacked high in one corner of the room. Rachel’s nervous attempt to smile did nothing to conceal her past, which was strewn with brutal felonies.\n\nSenatorial informants had very recently reported finding traces of Samuel's belongings in her garbage. He wondered how long it would take for her to eliminate evidence this time around. \"Hello, I'm Detective Winston,\" he introduced himself, \"I'm here to discuss some matters regarding a missing person case. The person in question is a man named Samuel.\"\n\nRachel simply nodded, attempting a composed demeanor. Winston cast a studied gaze around the room. She insisted on recycling habits, yet had carelessly tossed away valuable evidence. He shrugged off the carnal shiver that ran down his spine and decided to stir the pot a bit. \n\n\"Samuel was last seen on building surveillance entering the labyrinth,\" he started, \"It was also around the same time you were seen entering and leaving the labyrinth. He hasn’t appeared on any other footage – which leads me to suspect you might know more than what you’ve admitted.” \n\nRachel chose to remain in a trance of nonchalance as his words lingered in the silence. Samuel matched a distinct pattern. A profile of her victims, some of whom were found in the same labyrinth. A knock on her door meant the curtain was dropping on her deadly blend. She had murdered before, she was capable of murdering again.\n\nBracing herself, she toyed with the cuffs on her shirt, “I have served my time, detective,\" she whispered, \"I've paid my dues in full.\"\n\nWinston nodded, statements of past crimes echoing in his ears. \"That may be true, Rachel,\" he replied solemnly, \"But what about Samuel? He never showed up in any footage after he was last seen with you. Are we to believe it's another blend?\"\n\nRachel remained silent. She chose not to respond. Her complacency seemed to linger as Winston excused himself. Another labyrinth of lies, yet another familiar story. \"Well,\" he signed off, thinking about the sordid show in the labyrinth camera footage, \"Let's see how this unfolds.\"\n\nWinston pinched the bridge of his nose, staring at the entailments of the crime scene. The lifeless body of Samuel lay sprawled in the center of the labyrinth, a chilling testament to the fatal promise of its twisted paths.\n\nThe labyrinth had been under control of one person alone - Charlotte, choreographer extraordinaire. Winston remembered the stories he'd heard about Charlotte's fierce protectiveness, even leading to physical confrontations when it came to defending her sister.\n\nThe beauty of the aftermath was a cruel irony to Winston. He decided it was time to have a conversation with Miss Charlotte.\n\nArriving at the rehearsal hall, he could see Charlotte on the phone, her eyes scanning over the latest set designs. She ended her conversation and approached Winston, managing to smile warmly.\n\n\"Detective,\" Charlotte said. \"Has there been any news?\"\n\nWinston cleared his throat, \"Actually, I'd like to ask you a few questions.\"\n\nCharlotte nodded solemnly and offered him a chair. Immediately, Winston noticed the bottle of fine wine on the table, as well as opening tools, including a corkscrew Charlotte used to open boxes on the set.\n\n\"Winston began, \"It's common knowledge that you're a regular at the local wine tasting events.\"\n\nA blush dusted her cheeks, \"I do appreciate a good vintage.\"\n\n\"And you had the labyrinth all to yourself?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"A significant budget went into its design, and it was my responsibility to get it right,\" she admitted. \"I was alone in the labyrinth setting up for several hours. It's where I was when... it happened.\"\n\nShe grew quiet as the images of Samuel's body surely replayed in her mind. Winston took note of Charlotte's reaction; silence could be the greatest revealer of subtleties.\n\nIn his notes, he knew Samuel had been troubling Charlotte's sister, a young lady who was often teary-eyed and visibly shaken by the consistent hounding of the victim.\n\n\"I understand that Samuel had been causing much distress to your sister,\" Winston ventured gently, recalling the obvious pain and upset in the young lady's face every time Samuel's name was brought up.\n\n\"He was a menace and a leech!\" Her mouth snapped shut, the sudden burst of emotion quickly smothered.\n\nWith her reputation of being a fierce protector, there was no doubt that Charlotte had the capacity to defend her sister at any cost. His gaze flickered to the corkscrew once more.\n\nLetting out a low breath, Winston packed away his notes. The way the evidence piled up was unfolding like the carefully planned moves of a dance.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Charlotte\nB.

Nathaniel was methodically dissecting an entire neighborhood's refuse, picking valuable items that seemed to spark his interest from the detritus he sifted through. On Nathaniel’s trash run, he had picked up a wooden stick that sharply resembled a crossbow.\n\n“Hey Nathaniel, are you a huntsman by any chance?” Winston asked walking up to him. Nathaniel replied, “Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I am. I have a hunting license, and I even won a few archery contests back in the day.” His eyes twinkled at the memories. Winston nodded, keeping any additional comments to himself. \n\nOn the way back from their brief conversation, Winston noted something unusual for a garbage collector: an open novel, placed neatly beside Nathaniel’s bagged lunch. A genre-specific novel no less; its contents filled with murder and mayhem. Meeting Nathaniel's gaze, he nodded towards the book and asked, \"Reading on duty?\" Nathaniel chuckled and said, \"Aye, there's no policy against it, and the higher-ups don't seem to mind. It often makes for good conversation with coworkers. I often bring these novels to work as well. They come in handy during those discussions ironically.\"\n\nIntrigued, Winston checked with some of Nathaniel’s colleagues later that day. What he found was surprising - they all confirmed Nathaniel was quite the connoisseur when it came to discussing murder plots, often using his thriller novels as references. Oddly enough, he rarely brought any other type of books, always favoring murder and mayhem it seemed.\n\nAs Winston's day wore on, he remembered a report he had seen in the precinct earlier, filed by none other than Charlie. Charlie had reported missing valuables, specifically on the days Nathaniel would have his trash collection route.\n\nWinston also recalled a secondhand report about a public confrontation between Nathaniel and Charlie. The report stated that Charlie had \"called out\" Nathaniel for stealing his valuables from his trash. Piecing it together, Winston realized that Charlie's accusations and the missing items correlated with Nathaniel's collection days. He sighed, wondering if the rumors held any weight.\n\nRemembering another piece of information he picked up earlier, he roamed to the back alley adjacent to Charlie's house. Nathaniel was indeed seen sifting through Charlie's trash on multiple occasions, acquiring items of value. This linked well with what the confrontation and the report seemed to suggest. However, none of this established Nathaniel as Charlie's killer.\n\nAs Winston drove back to the precinct, he couldn’t shake off the circular puzzle that had begun to form in his mind, a puzzle as murky and enigmatic as the swamp that held Charlie's lifeless body. But his instincts had served him well before, and he was determined to see the case through, wherever it may lead.\n\nHaving a quick glance at his notes, Winston's eyes lingered on some key details about his prime suspect in this murder case. Bridget, the ex-wife of Charlie, who was without an evident alibi for the time of the murder. Charlie's life ended tragically in the heart of the swamp, a place where he loved to visit, quite often alone. He was taken down by a lethal crossbow bolt. Recalling that Charlie had changed his will last week without telling Bridget, Winston felt a twinge of unease. He shook his head, massaging his tired temples before heading off to where Bridget was staying.\n\nHe found Bridget in her backyard, busy practicing with her crossbow—an activity she was ardently committed to, despite varied environments. Her talented handling of the weapon suggested much experience, most likely from her hunting trips to the swamp with her ex-husband, Charlie. Lying next to her crossbow was a pack of new bolts, recently purchased, Winston pieced together. \n\n\"Bridget?\" Winston asked, stepping forward. \n\n\"That would be me,\" she replied, setting her crossbow down on a nearby tree stump.\n\n\"Bridget, it seems like you knew Charlie would be at the swamp the day he was killed,\" he pointed, maintaining eye contact whilst pulling out his notepad.\n\n\"Yeah, we used to fish and hunt out there a lot. Charlie loved that place. Why?\" she asked guardedly.\n\nIgnoring her question, he inquired again. \"It says you've been defaulting on your loan repayments lately and your business declared bankruptcy recently. What else aren't you telling me, Bridget?\"\n\nLooking both surprised and annoyed, she retorted by defending herself, \"I have nothing to hide.\"\n\nWinston merely nodded, scribbling a few notes down before leaving Bridget in the backyard next to her fresh set of crossbow bolts. The wheels of the investigation were starting to turn and Winston intended to ride the momentum until he found Charlie's killer.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

His gaze shifted to a tall woman energetically engaging with her relatives, her vibrant energy palpable amongst the crowd. That would be Mya, the adventurous cousin of the unfortunate victim, Skylar.\n\nHe noticed the polished locket adorning her neck, catching the light beautifully, but a sombre contrast to its owner's lively charm.\n\nExuding friendly charm, Winston approached her, \"Mya, may I have a couple of moments?\"\n\n\"Of course, detective. How may I help you?\"\n\n\"I understand you and Skylar used to explore your adventurous side together,\" Winston mentioned casually, trying not to stir any emotional discomfort.\n\nMya's face softened, \"Yes. We both shared a love for the wilderness. Just last week, she invited me on a camping trip to the rainforest. It was harmonious escapades until…” she trailed off.\n\n“Aye, I’m sorry for your loss, Mya.”  \n \nWinston noticed the emphasis on her well-toned physique - a strong and agile body, built on a rigorous exercise routine and several hiking and mountain climbing expeditions successfully completed over the years.\n\nLater on, Winston got an opportunity to evaluate the surveillance video of the day Skylar went missing. A quiet scene it was, with only a single instance of incoming and no outgoing traffic - a four-wheel-drive carrying two adventurous souls - Skylar and Mya - into the depths of the rainforest.\n\nWinston’s keen eyes caught the glimpse of Mya’s camping gear. It sure was well stocked - ropes, food supplies, a lead pipe, tents, boots… A lead pipe. The very same, that had turned brutal enough to end a life in the tranquil rainforest.\n\nAt Mya’s, while she was away, Winston could only find her camping gear partially scattered in disarray. The lead pipe was blatantly missing.\n\nIn a cruiser parked down the street, Winston watched Mya jog up to the deadly rainforest, maybe a run to process her grief, or maybe it was part of her regular exercise routine. Winston watched Mya stoop suddenly and pick something up. A glint of gold. Later, at the reunion, the piece was identified as Skylar’s locket around Mya’s neck. A locket that mysteriously went missing after Skylar's demise and never returned to the rightful inheritors.\n\nWinston took a deep breath. There was so much more to untangle in the mysterious disappearance of Skylar. The case continued to thicken, deeper into the rainforest.\n\nCasual drizzle splattered against the umbrella of Winston as he stood by the yellow cab, its windows slick with rain and partially hiding the figure inside. He knocked twice against the window before it hesitantly slid down, revealing the rough and worn face of Albert, a cab driver who had been working these city streets for longer than most would care to remember. \n\n\"Albert,\" Winston began, pulling out his badge to cut off any question of his identity. \"Seems like you're having a quiet night.\"\n\n\"Just like every other night in this forsaken city,\" Albert responded bitterly, his hands, the hands of a man used to hard labor, tightening around the taxi steering wheel. \n\n\"I heard about your baseball career back in college. Must have been exciting times,\" Winston remarked, casually glancing at a lead pipe secured beneath the driver's seat. \"Got to make sure feelings of nostalgia don't lead to some baseball practice, especially not in a city like ours.\"\n\nAlbert hesitated for a moment, before answering, \"It's for safety. Different times…\"\n\nWinston nodded, turning towards the rainforest in the distance. Albert followed his gaze, \"Crazy what happened. I was just driving her, Skylar...that is, to the rainforest. The city loved her, I've even seen people switch cabs to ride with her.\"\n\n\"Must have been a challenge,\" Winston said, subtly hinting at the power dynamics at play.\n\n\"It was more than just a challenge,\" Albert growled. \"That woman was taking away everything I had.\"\n\n\"Do you know why she wanted to go to the rainforest?\" Winston asked, eager to shift the focus.\n\n\"Didn't ask,\" Albert responded briskly. \"She requested me as her driver and asked to go to the rainforest. Took a little detour, tried to show her some city charm...wouldn't say she really appreciated it though.\"\n\n\"Do you know if anyone else was with her there?\"\n\n\"Just her,\" Albert answered. \"As far as I knew, it was just going to be her in the rainforest. That was the last I saw.\"\n\nAs Winston walked away, leaving Albert with his rumbling taxi and burdensome thoughts, he pondered how volatile resentment could become if not managed properly — a flame which could engulf the careers and lives of even those most loved. The rain pattered against his umbrella, but beneath it, his mind was turning.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Albert\nB.

The clues were frustratingly scarce - no fingerprints, no forced entry, and the murder weapon, poisonous gas, a lethal specter leaving no traceable footprints. He put on a pair of gloves and sifted through the crime scene photos, his eyes resting on one of Penelope, Tessa's tarot card reader.\n\nPenelope, decked in an extravagant costume, stood out against the throng of guests at the gala. The disguise concealed much of her face, but it was an ineffective veil for her true intent. Winston wasn't looking for her in person; he was instead hoping to unravel the layers of her past.\n\nHe turned his attention to the stream of reports from the other officer. No one remembered conversing with Penelope throughout the evening. Winston rubbed his stubbled chin.\n\n\"Got a statement saying Penelope was alone in Tessa's kitchen during her tarot reading session,\" the officer informed Winston. \"And she was seen arriving prior to the murder. And just before the time of the murder, multiple witnesses claim they saw Penelope hurriedly leaving Tessa's kitchen, disappearing from the view. However, no one reported seeing Penelope leave Tessa's place before Tessa's lifeless body was found\".\n\nWinston felt a chill in his spine as he imagined the confrontation that could have happened in the intimacy of Tessa's kitchen. The letters, the crucial evidence in Tessa's hands, holding the ink stains of Penelope's past crimes, would likely have hit Penelope like a freight train. And, according to Winston's informants, Tessa had indeed confronted Penelope about these crimes, engendering a strong reaction in Penelope; her fear was palpable, even to those who had reported the confrontation.\n\n\"Well now, Penelope. What have you been up to?\" Winston murmured to himself as he placed the stack of documents on his desk.\n\nThere was something about Tessa's knowledge about Penelope's past, about Tessa's confrontation, about Penelope's fearful reaction. Plenty of smoke, Winston thought, but where's the fire?\n\nEverything linked together so subtly. He sighed, running his hands through his hair. Despite the baffling circumstances of the case, Winston knew one fact: he had a pressing investigation ahead of him. It was going to be a long night.\n\nWinston sat hunched over a map pinned to a wall, hand gripping a steaming cup of coffee. Spread out on a desk below, a sprawl of case files surrounded an opened notebook filled with scrawls and coffee rings. As a former officer himself, he knew that standard police training involved the handling of dangerous substances. The ring of a phone broke his contemplation and as he picked it up, the familiar voice of the dispatcher told him he was needed at the scene of a potential gas leak. The location sounded familiar. He sighed, downed the last of his coffee, and grabbed his coat.\n\nArriving at the house, he was surprised to see Officer Melody securing the scene. She was a friendly face, someone he'd dealt with on many occasions. Her patrol fell largely within the residential district, and Tessa's home was one of the many stops on her beat.\n\nThe moment he stepped out of his car, the pungent smell of gas filled his nostrils. He quickly made his way to Melody. \"Gas leak, huh?\" Winston asked, looking at the small, attractive home. Melody turned to him, nodding slowly, \"Came in as that, yes,\" she replied, her voice betraying a hint of concern. \"It's Tessa's place...\"\n\nMelody led him to the kitchen, where the gas leak had occurred. The cold, lifeless body of Tessa lay sprawled on the floor. As part of her duties, Melody filled out the police report, marking down vital details.\n\nDuring their conversation, Winston found out that Melody had been on active duty on the day of the murder, her name clearly listed on the roster. It wasn't unexpected. Melody put in more hours than most other officers, often going above and beyond her duties.\n\nAs Melody was talking, Winston's gaze was drawn to a certificate hung on the wall of her patrol car denoting her authorized clearance to use poisonous gas in the case of an emergency. The police department did keep a small supply for situations that demanded it, and Melody, like all other officers, had been trained in the handling of such dangerous substances.\n\nWinston learned a shocking fact as he delved into the case. Tessa's bakery, which sat right in the middle of Melody's patrol zone, was the only establishment that was hindering the territorial expansion Melody had been working towards. The bakery had been a bone of contention for Melody, who had made several offers to Tessa trying to negotiate some form of compromise. But Tessa, it seems, had flatly refused every single one.\n\nAs Winston departed the crime scene, he noted that Melody had taken additional courses on handling hazardous materials. But she had always considered herself to be a vigilant public servant. A protector. And as he looked back at Tessa's house, surrounded by yellow tape, he made a note to dig deeper. To understand how the life of a simple baker could intersect so tragically with that of a devoted police officer, and a gas leak that became deadly.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The silhouette of a house loomed ahead. A grim thought etched itself into his mind as he thought about the unlocked front door, later found locked from the outside, and the lifeless body of Charlotte inside.\n\nWinston stepped out of the vehicle, reviewing the case notes. He needed to talk to the last person to see Charlotte alive - Deborah, the driver that Charlotte had recently hired and brought over explicitly for a job discussion.\n\nThrough office gossip, Winston had heard about Charlotte’s demeaning behavior. Stories about how she continually undermined Deborah's skills and how she spread harmful rumors about Deborah echoed in his mind. He was aware of Charlotte’s public disdain for Deborah, paying no heed to the curious and concerned stares of onlookers.\n\nSpotting Deborah in the front yard, he noticed her clutching her phone. It was well-known that Deborah always had her phone with her, even while chatting with friends - a frequent sight in any social occasion. \"Deborah,\" Winston greeted her as he approached.\n\n\"Detective,” Deborah acknowledged, only sparing a quick glance before her eyes drifted back to her phone.\n\n\"I hear you were here to work for Charlotte,\" Winston began. \"Can you tell me about your last meeting?\"\n\nDeborah, still fixed on her phone, shifted uncomfortably. \"Charlotte invited me over. She had a job opportunity she wanted to discuss.” Her voice was quiet, barely a whisper above the rain. \"We had some disagreements about my preparedness for the job,\" she added, \"I questioned her assessment, but she was adamant, refusing to accept my objections.\"\n\n\"Do tell,\" Winston poked, as he scribbled in his notepad.\n\n\"She never missed a chance to spend me down, even in public places,\" Deborah vented, her eyes briefly meeting Winston's before dropping to the ground - a habit she exhibited when prodded about her private life. Winston decided to dive a little deeper into her relationship with Charlotte. \n\nImmediately, she averted her gaze and fiercely focused on her phone, a clear sign Deborah was uncomfortable with the subject. \"Instead, allow me to share that her mistreatment didn't stop at belittlement. She also spread damaging rumors about me.\"\n\n“Makes sense,\" Winston sighed. \"Would you mind telling me how you got in the house? The front door was found locked from the outside after.”\n\nWithout a word, Deborah produced the keys to Charlotte’s house, jingling them in her hand. Her focus returned to her phone.\n\n“And you arrived just prior to the unfortunate incident?”\n\n\"Yes,\" she swallowed hard, her downcast eyes not leaving the ground, \"I was... I guess... the last to see her alive.\"\n\nThe detective sensed the gravity of the situation weighing on her. He decided to give her some space, leaving Deborah to her continuous phone notifications and the rain-soaked yard.\n\nWinston sat quietly at his desk, fingers drumming on top of the Charlotte investigation file. On his screen was paused security footage from a well-known Pawn Shop around town. A woman resembling Letti was seen talking to the storekeeper, a transaction taking place that was later confirmed by the storekeeper to be the purchase of a stun gun.\n\nSuddenly, a buzz in his pocket. Picking up his ringing phone, he heard a shaken voice. Jane, Charlotte's housekeeper.\n\n\"Detective Winston?\" she sounded concerned, \"It was only Charlotte and Letti in the kitchen that night.\"\n\nWinston thanked her and ended the call. His mind was already piecing together the day's events. A picture of Letti entering Charlotte's house emerged from a Putney slasher camera that was fortuitously pointing towards Charlotte's house. The day? The day Charlotte was found dead, dead in the secluded kitchen of her grand house.\n\nWith thoughts swirling in his head, Winston pushed his chair back and walked towards his coat. His first stop was going to be a chat with Letti. He knew from her record that Letti had been taking self-defense classes where they taught her how to use stun guns and other weapons. \n\nIn the lobby of a tall building, Letti acknowledged Winston's presence with a wave before walking towards him. In her early days, she was an energetic groupie. However, in the same lobby surveillance, Winston saw her effectively use a stun gun that she had likely learned from her self-defense classes when confronted by an over-zealous fan.\n\n\"Good evening, Detective.\" Letti's melodious voice cut through the silent hall.\n\n\"Let's talk about your visit to Charlotte on the day of her demise.\" Winston's eyes bore into Letti's, which blinked before answering.\n\n\"She invited me over for dinner,\" Letti's voice was unwavered, \"Call it a friendly chat.\"\n\nThe conversation between Charlotte and Letti, as hinted at by Charlotte's friend, had turned into a confession session. Letti had given an account of a past crime, a delicate secret that now laid bare between both of them. Charlotte's friend also mentioned that Charlotte had expressed her worries about a nosy reporter persistently asking about Letti's secret and the potential damage it could do to her career if it became public. \n\nThe direction of Winston's investigation was turning towards Letti. The focus of reporters - the constant probing about her relationship with Charlotte, the incessant questions about any potential controversies - further added a dimension of urgency to her. \n\n“I had to confess,” Letti offered up. “The news wasn’t pleasant, and I had to seek advice.”\n\nCharlotte's kitchen was secluded from the rest of the house. A personal sin bin where the victim met her tragic end. Winston could only nod. Listening and observing, his duty continued. He would leave the concluding to the ones seated on the jury.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Letti\nB.

He had just finished getting the report from the establishment confirming that only Mia had booked the private dining area the previous night. Emma, an emerging political whiz-kid, had been found dead on the lavish dining table.\n\n\"Mia,\" Winston muttered to himself whilst turning his car's ignition. A well-known politician, she had been married to Emma.\n\nAfter checking his notes, Winston dropped by the shooting range. He'd heard Mia was a regular there. He took a seat in the observation area, watching as Mia effortlessly hit targets at incredible ranges. Word had it, Mia had secured several victory titles in various shooting competitions around the city.\n\nThe shooting range offered more than targeting practice. The place also sold a range of guns and ammunition. As he walked around the range, he noted the various types of ammunition on offer, including a type of ammunition recently purchased by Mia that coincidentally matched the type used in the murder weapon found at the restaurant.\n\nOnce she finished with her practice, Winston approached Mia, asking if they could head to a nearby café to chat. Multiple eyewitness accounts corroborated her presence at the restaurant the night before, so he wanted to get her take on events.\n\nThe pair discussed the city's sights, the weather, but mostly their jobs. Both women were well-known politicians, each with her own challenges. Emma had been gaining public approval for her stance on various political issues, hinting at a bright future in politics. It was widely rumored that Emma planned to unveil a series of scandals surrounding Mia in the coming weeks.\n\nAs they wrapped up their conversation, Winston asked Mia about the private dining area at the restaurant.\n\n“Yes, I had booked it for the evening,\" Mia admitted, \"It was easier to discuss our issues in private. It was only for Emma and I. In fact, I was the only one that had the keys to that area. We used to frequent that place, and I had the keys to ensure privacy whenever we needed it.”\n\nThey were pictured dining together by onlookers earlier that evening, not long before Emma was found dead, Winston thought. The information he'd gathered was piling up. It was time to go back to the station and untangle this web of information. \n\n“Thanks for the catch-up Mia, and the espresso. We’ll be in touch,\" Winston said as he rose from his seat. The mystery of Emma's death was far from over, but every conversation provided another piece of the puzzle.\n\nDetective Winston untwisted the final thread of his woolen wrap, the chilling winter wind sweeping through the luxury restaurant caused the patrons to shiver. Even though the place was filled with the sound of tinkling glassware and soft murmurs, Winston’s thoughts trailed towards Emma...\n\nEmerald-eyed Emma, who recently came into an immense inheritance. Such a windfall was more money than anyone else in their social circle, making her the only one who could financially save Warren from his mounting debts.. Winston swallowed back a bitter taste and turned towards his current predicament, a quiet table in the corner housing a man named Warren.\n\nWarren, Emma's grandfather, a well-known introvert and a man of old-world charm. A hoarder of antiques, he frequently surrounded himself with relics of the past. As Winston caught sight of Warren, he noticed his safety haven of antiques marking a stark contrast in the ultra-modern ambience of the restaurant. On the table lay an old-fashioned monocle, an antique pocket watch and a vintage military style pistol. The trove of antiques were a reflection of Warren's keen interest in collectables, drawing Winston towards a long lost era which seemed to be preserved in their presence.\n\n\"Let's get right to it then,\" Warren began, his baritone voice vibrating through the room, making Winston come back to the present. \"You want to know about Emma. About the money, the pistol... my part in it. Well, ask away,\" he said, fingers clasping tightly around a cane with an eagle-headed handle, face etched in grim determination.\n\n\"Mr. Warren, your military background,\" Winston began, gauging the man before him. \"Active combat, so I heard.\"\n\nA pause persisted around them, Warren closing his eyes briefly, as if the memories were debilitating. When he spoke again, his voice was softer. \"War... it changes a man. The army teaches you things. How to handle a firearm, for insta--\" He abruptly halted his sentence, eyes darting nervously towards the pistol on the table.\n\nWarren continued to maintain the silence that lingered in the air, but his discomfort was palpable -- almost tangible. Winston took note of the man’s unease during conversations reflecting his introverted nature.\n\n\"Emma's money, it saved you from debt, did it not?\" Winston prodded gently, trying to keep the conversation going despite Warren’s discomfort. The older man let out a soft sigh, his discomfort apparent. \"It was no secret I was neck-deep in debt and Emma was my only salvation,\" he conceded, \"I did seek help from her, but Emma...\" he trailed off, avoiding eye contact. \n\nWinston excused himself, not wanting to push the introverted man farther into his discomfort. As he walked away from Warren, he took one final glance back at the man surrounded by his personal collection of antiques. His military accolades, the distinct lack of comfort during conversations, the urgency for Emma's money, all painted a complicated, yet silent picture. \n\nA picture Winston was yet to piece together... where the truth lay, buried deep within the pieces.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Another one bit the dust in Times Square, a pretty common sight as of late. Jay, the regular local of the square, had made another one of his notorious catches, or so he seemed to be trying to. This time, however, it wasn't in the joy of celebration. \n\nArresting the immediate crime scene routine, it came to an adoptive father. Jay, a man who loved his adopted son, Johnny, as deeply as his own blood. Unmistakably, he treated him with undying affection. Jay was a local fisherman, known to bait his lines and toss his nets in Times Square us with unusual regularity.\n\nWinston was no stranger to the peculiar. A man making his catch amidst the solemn sea of humanity seemed alien yet plausible in ways nothing else could be. Winston lit another cigarette, his eyes tracing the hotel reservation confirmation in Jay’s name at a nearby hotel; Jay was also at Times Square for New Year's celebrations.\n\nNow, that wasn’t unusual. After all, many locals booked rooms not far to be around the electric New Year’s celebration. Johnny, too, was part of the cacophony that night, showering in the confetti rain and the bursts of fireworks.\n\nA cold shiver ran down Winston's spine as he recalled a conversation he had picked up where Jay overheard Johnny's intention to expose his illegal fishery.\n\nThe dynamics between a father and son duo is a complex bond. Johnny had officially registered himself under Jay’s guardianship quite a while ago, and now his disclosure had ignited an unexpected storm. \n\nWinston dropped his gaze onto the pictures of Jay's house. A noticeable collection caught his eyes. A vast array of tridents, carefully displayed and proudly shown off to any guest entering his abode. With an uneasiness settling over him, Winston noted that one of the tridents was strikingly similar to the weapon linked to Johnny's murder.\n\nWinston took the last puff of his cigarette, and he ground the stub into the ashtray, turning over all the facts in his head. Already, the investigation looked murky, muddled with familial ties and sinister events.\n\nDespite the rising sun casting long shadows, the path before Winston remained dark.\n\nIt was time to interview Jay, Winston decided, as he pieced together the intricate pattern connecting paternity, fishing, and a bloody murder.\n\nWinston viewed the stark crime scene photos of Johnny's brutal murder in Times Square. The murder weapon was a trident, an oddity in any case, which only added to the eerie nature of Times Square, a place that seemed to attract all sorts of outlandish incidents.\n\nHis only solid lead so far was stock broker Karl, whom Johnny had been suspicious of. Karl was known to deal with more than just Wall Street, handling the financial investments of some of the most prominent celebrities. Well-known for his connections and unconventional tactics, it was rumored that he often used insider information for personal gain, a decidedly illegal maneuver on the stock market.\n\nDuring their final showdown, Johnny had threatened to go to the police with evidence that pointed to Karl's crooked stock manipulations. But Johnny was brutally murdered before he could even do so. Now, as he viewed the images of Johnny's murder, Winston felt a deepening sense of dread.\n\nIt was time to question Karl. Upon arrival in the heart of Wall Street where Karl had his office, he found a bustling hub of blue suits. Amidst this flurry, Karl stood out, impeccably dressed and complete with a cordial smile he typically saved for his high-profile clients.\n\n\"Greetings, Detective,\" Karl said calmly.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Karl,\" Winston replied, keeping his tone neutral. \"Can we have a moment to speak in private?\"\n\nIn Karl's luxurious private office, an array of historical weapons adorned the walls, an unusual decorative taste for a corporate figure. Winston began the conversation stating the facts he already knew, \"So you're a fan of historical weapons?\"\n\n\"Not just a fan,\" Karl replied, putting on a proud smile, \"Last summer, I even took lessons in trident fighting. It's all part of my personal life that I’d rather keep to myself. I’m not too fond of sharing personal information.\"\n\nUpon digging deeper into Karl's dealings, Karl became visibly uncomfortable. His stiff body language indicated that he wasn't too keen on discussing his personal life further. Winston, however, continued to press on, bringing up Johnny and the documents he had left behind before his death - evidence of Karl's illegal stock manipulation.\n\nKarl retained an impressively unflappable demeanor, revealing no hints of guilt or remorse. However, the mention of Johnny and the documents seemed to create a ripple in his stoic shell.\n\nThen a call came to Winston's phone; it was his assistant informing him of the result of the search at Karl's house. Among the collection of historical artifacts and weapons, a trident was found - a chilling answer to the choice of murder weapon.\n\nConfronting Karl with this latest discovery, Winston noticed a visible strain on Karl's face, his corporate mask slipping momentarily. After bidding him goodbye, Winston left the office, leaving a now silent Karl amongst his historical weapons and luxurious comforts. His passion for historical warfare had now become the primary focus of the murder investigation.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Jay\nB.

The murder scene was an unsavory juxtaposition of innocence - usually bustling with kids, laughter, and vibrant life, now tainted with the solemnity of demise and the faint smell of bleach lingering in the air. \n\nHis next step was Helen, Mack's sole testamentary beneficiary it seemed, and his housekeeper - a critical point of interest.\n\nArriving at the soccer field, he spotted Helen from afar, scrubbing away at the stubborn grass stains with a generous amount of bleach - a daily routine in her housekeeping duties. She was an efficient worker, with knowledge on various cleaning products and supplies, which her job demanded.\n\nHis eyes became glued to a large quantity of bleach that Helen had with her. An unsettling thought crossed his mind, quickly followed by a dismissive wave. \n\nWinston introduced himself to Helen who was already there. Judging by her demeanor, he got an underlying sense of humiliation boiling within her, perhaps a result of being objectified at her job as a housekeeper. \n\n\"Do you clean up after the games every time?\" Winston asked, breaking the tense silence.\n\n\"Every single time. They don't clean up after themselves, so someone's got to do it,\" Helen said, her tone full of regrettable resignation, showing no signs of withholding information.\n\n\"So, you were here, even when the game was on?\" Winston then asked, the seemingly benign query holding a latent inquiry.\n\n“Yes, and Mr. Mack, bless his soul, stayed behind with me after everyone else had left,” Helen replied, burrowing her frown even further, eyes welling up with unseen tears. \n\nShe continued talking away, inadvertently revealing how she's often at the rough end of some nasty backbiting, making Winston wonder if that might've fuelled her self-diminution.\n\n\"Are you Mack's housekeeper?\" Winston asked, out of the blue, seemingly testing Helen's patience.\n\nShe stared at him for a solid minute before affirming she was, indeed, Mack's housekeeper. Mack, she recalled, even included Helen's role in his will, stating that she should run the house in the event of his untimely demise. \n\nWith an interview like this, it was hard not to observe how it all seemed to add up, but Winston prudently kept his findings to himself.\n\nAs Winston returned to his car, he remembered Mack, a man with no family, found dead right after one such soccer game Helen was apparently cleaning up for. He also remembered an incident involving Helen from the past – an unfortunate mishap where a staff member had accidentally ingested a cleaning supply.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston muttered to himself, starting his car. \"Very interesting indeed.\"\n\nThis was going to be a long case.\n\nWinston idly flicked through the passport he had received from a fellow officer, who found it thrown aside at the soccer field, where teenagers often conjugated. \"Maria,\" he read aloud from the passport photo. He flipped it over to find another stamp from Denmark and a passport photo stapled to the back – \"Chloe, Denmark.\" Holy hell, what a lead.\n\nTurning his attention to the crime scene, it wasn't long before Detective Winston found himself on the doorstep of Danielle, the local spiritual guru, alternatively known as Maria and Chloe in her past.\n\nDanielle's reputation preceded her not just for her aliases but also for her meticulous cleaning which she considered a spiritual activity. \"It's a form of meditation for me, I find serenity in cleanliness,\" Danielle replied to Winston's gentle ribbing, with a slight smile.\n\n\"Is that why you’re against Mack's wedding?\" Winston asked. She blinked at him. \"Rumor has it, you've taken quite the interest in Mack's so called love-life.\" \n\nDanielle, in her belief of spiritual purity, confessed, \"Harmful karmic consequences often ensue when one person pledges themselves to someone they do not love. Mack was about to please his parents by making such a mistake, marrying a woman he didn't care for. I wanted Mack to remain single, as I believe it would have maintained his spiritual purity.\"\n\nShe paused to siphon some tea from a kettle, her eyes never leaving Winston. \"By the way, Detective, I think you’ve dropped something,\" she said, pointing at the passport Winston had forgotten in his jacket pocket. \"Oh, that?\" he asked nonchalantly, \"It's your passport, isn’t it? Maria, Chloe, all your aliases, found at the crime scene.\"\n\nDanielle gave it a fleeting glance and said, \"Ah I see, Detective. Still, it's not the one I use currently... I don't need a passport to travel. I have lived in many places under many names, including Sophie in France.\"\n\nWinston kicked a stone down the road as he left Danielle's residence, pondering on her confessions. \"Sophie, France\", he mumbled to himself. More identities. More questions. \n\nBack at the station, he poured over the evidence once more which also had multiples items linking Danielle to the alias Sophie in France. Mack was about to wed a woman he didn’t love just to please his parents... and there he lay on the soccer field, with the smell of bleach fresh in his throat.

The circumstances were grim. A man named Jerry had been found dead in the stark and empty landscape, a case that threw detective Winston out of urban comfort.\n\nThe next lead was Maurice, a neighborhood resident for the longest time and a paramedic at a local hospital, according to the locals. His house was a familiar blue building in the community. A nearby neighbor, busily mowing her lawn, waved a hearty hello. She then pointed towards the hospital, calling out, \"Maurice's place is over there, but you'd most likely find him at the hospital!\"\n\nWinston inquired, \"The hospital? He works there?\" \n\n\"Oh, yes! Maurice's been working there for years,\" the neighbor responded. \n\nWinston thanked her for the helpful information and made his way to the blue building. From there, he found Maurice finishing his daytime shift, a regular occurrence according to hospital records, at the hospital.\n\nCapturing the attention of Maurice, he questioned, \"I received a report that you were with Jerry in the desert earlier today?\"\n\nMaurice paused, met Winston's intense probing gaze, then nodded. \"Yes sir, I got a call for a medical emergency. Got there, found Jerry needing help. I was the only other person out there, sir. I swear it.\"\n\nMoving across the hospital parking lot, Winston noticed a van parked in the corner. It looked eerily familiar as it matched the description given by witnesses who claimed to have seen a similar paramedic's van parked in the desert on the day of Jerry's murder.\n\nRecalling a document he had gone through recently, Winston gathered that Maurice was due for trial soon. Allegedly, his former nurse had exposed him for unethical medical practices. If he was proven guilty, the consequence would be prison time. Coincidentally, the key witness in the malpractice case was none other than the recently departed, Jerry.\n\nLater, while in conversation with another nurse, Winston discovered that complaints about Maurice's professional ethics were not new. His patients, all former ones now, had lodged several complaints about him.\n\nExiting the hospital, Winston considered the revelations of the day. Despite the desert heat, a chill ran through him. He tactfully tapped the case file under his arm, knowing fully well that there was much to uncover in this investigation.\n\nDetective Winston squinted against the sunlight as he glanced towards the distant hills - the desert where Jerry was killed the night before. A desert that Winston knew served a dual purpose. While Rex, the florist, went there to pick native flowers, he also had a setup hidden amidst the sparse desert vegetation where he would prepare his out-of-town floral arrangements.  Jerry had been meeting him in this secluded spot to discuss these unique arrangements.\n\nWalking back to his vehicle through the bare, hot desert landscape, Winston started flipping through his notebook. The puzzle pieces were starting to form an alarming picture. Winston had discovered a hefty amount of money requested by Jerry from Rex, in return for his silence. With Jerry's meetings in the desert with Rex at his setup becoming more frequent, it was clear that Jerry was onto something big here.\n\nRex, the florist who owned that quirky flower shop and the adjacent tool supply store in town, had an apparent penchant for illicit activities. In his tool store, one could find all manner of gardening tools, even lead pipes, kept casually among the spades and hoes. Jerry's interest in Rex's store wasn't casual - Rex had been illegally importing exotic flowers, and Jerry had caught on. He even threatened to expose Rex's illegal activities, putting Rex's successful reputation as the owner of the renowned shop 'Blossoms & Thorns' in jeopardy.\n\nWhen Winston reached the town, he navigated through its narrow lanes and pulled into 'Blossoms & Thorns’. Looking around the shop, Winston noticed the impressive array of exotic flowers. Each one unique, each one illegally imported. These were the flowers that pulled a crowd, and they were also used in Rex's out-of-town flower arrangements that were prepared in the desert setup. The costs to bring these exotic flowers put Rex hugely in debt.\n\nWinston glanced at the large farming tools casually placed near Rex. There were spades, hoes, and lead pipes, each used frequently enough to blend in perfectly. Rex, with his impressive physical strength apparent from his ability to move large pots with ease, was used to handling these tools with no difficulty. But could he have used a lead pipe just as efficiently?\n\nAs Rex moved another pot, Winston brought up the topic nonchalantly - \"Flower-picking this morning, Rex?\" \n\nRex nodded, his attention clearly elsewhere, \"Yes, there are some fine native flowers out in the desert, particularly this time of year. I picked some for my out-of-town arrangements.\"\n\nStudying Rex, Winston knew all the signs were there - the lead pipe, the strength, the threats of exposure from Jerry, and the desperation of a man drowning in debt. Rex's weak reply hung heavy in the air - as did Winston's unsaid accusation. \n\n“Shame about Jerry though,” Winston said after a moment of silence.\n\nRex tensed, “Yes... real shame.” As if to forget the very thought, he turned around and continued working, his entire life revolving around a business that could cost him everything, including his respected reputation. The question still remained - had it already cost him a life?\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Maurice\nB.

Eugene had been a regular player at the local laser tag arena and had just recently spoken publicly about an upcoming event. Tragically, the last event proved fatal for him.\n\nWinston moved his attention from the depressing case files to a stack of books lent to him by the local library. All were martial arts manuals. He grabbed one at random and idly flipped through it. Being a tenured police officer, he could tell those books had been heavily used. The slight creases on the spine, the wear on the edges of the book indicated to someone's use. And that someone happened to be his prime suspect: Timothy, the novelist.\n\nTimothy was known for his meticulous crafting of characters, mimicking their behaviors and mannerisms. He was currently working on a secretive character. People often tried to ask about Timothy's childhood to understand better where he derived his characters. However, he generally kept his past to himself. Locating Timothy's house, Winston decided it was time to pay a visit.\n\nWinston knocked on the door, and eventually, Timothy answered.\n\n\"Detective Winston,\" Winston said, holding up his badge. \"Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?\"\n\nWith Timothy's compliance, they settled on the sofa in the living room. Winston noticed more martial arts books on the coffee table, and the various photos of Timothy at martial arts classes that lined the walls.\n\n\"You seem to have a great interest in martial arts,\" Winston observed.\n\n\"Yeah, I go to a class every week,\" replied Timothy. \"It helps me in my writing.\"\n\n\"Dabbling in martial arts for your new character?\" asked Winston curiously. \n\n\"Indeed,\" replied Timothy with a laugh. \n\nTimothy's phone buzzed, disrupting their conversation. After checking it, he made a face and sighed. He put it aside, glancing at Winston. \"Let's not dwell on the past, shall we?\"\n\nSurprised by Timothy’s response, which he typically gave when people asked about his childhood, Wiston decided to redirect the conversation.\n\nTimothy then pointed to a stack of documents on the coffee table, \"I signed up for the laser tag event. Eugene and I were planning to be on the same team. We played together all the time.\"\n\nRemembering Eugene's public announcement and the photos of Timothy at the laser tag events, Winston nodded. Time to tackle one case at a time.\n\nAs Winston left, he got a clearer picture of Timothy: the martial artists manuals, the laser tag documents, and Timothy's habit of immersing himself into his characters. All this information was creating a mind map of the situation in his mind.\n\nWinston finished his cup of morning joe, reading through the tedious paperwork once more. Eugene had been found dead in the laser tag arena, laying coldly next to neon walls and the echoes of laughter. The weapon of choice, a nunchaku, placing a grim shadow over childhood fun. It seemed the murder had taken place during the team building event itself.\n\nReady for another day in the field, Winston decided to visit his only suspect, Adam, owner and operator of a local zoo. He arrived at the zoo just in time to witness the unique spectacle of Adam deftly practicing martial arts with a nunchaku within one of the empty enclosures while the animals were being fed.\n\nAdam was a stout man, seemingly, as comfortable with dangerous animals as he was with the simple tasks of running a zoo. Each enclosure had a plaque, with a little note, 'Owned and managed by the Jones family for generations'. Adam was the newest torch-bearer of the Jones family legacy.\n\n\"You Adam?\" asked Winston, walking towards him.\n\n\"Yes, sir. Is there something you need?\" replied Adam, dusting off his hands.\n\n\"I'm Detective Winston, looking into the murder of Eugene. I understand you two were at a team building event together?\" \n\n\"We were in the same laser tag team. Yes, it was hardly a pleasant event, considering how it ended,\" Adam responded, a thin veil of remorse could be detected in his gaze.\n\n\"Witnesses have said that they saw you two chatting during the event - an argument perhaps?\" Winston continued. \n\nAdam didn’t deny it. \"We did, over a few allegations he made about my zoo. He was putting it on the record that there were multiple safety violations here.\"\n\nWinston changed the subject, \"Did you buy something from the gift shop here at your zoo? Maybe...nunchaku?\"\n\nAdam, startled by Winston's directness, simply tipped his cowboy hat in acquiescence. \"Yeah, I bought one from our shop. I've practiced some martial art forms using nunchaku during my free time, mostly right here at the zoo.\"\n\nTaking that in, Winston asked further. \"How about your feeding times?\"\n\nAdam arched an eyebrow and gestured towards the animals, replying \"Usually line up with the martial arts classes at town sports center, why?\"\n\nWinston gave a dismissive wave of the hand, \"Just curious. Take care, Adam.\"\n\nWith that, Winston retreated to collect his thoughts. One thing he knew for certain, the list of suspects wasn't going to extend beyond this zookeeper for a while.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Timothy\nB.

The facts at hand seemed to spin an intricate web, but the threads only made sense one at a time. \n\nNicole, art collector by profession, was ostensibly the last one to see Wilhelmina. They had been scheduled for a meeting at Nicole's house where Nicole had stayed in all day, in the very kitchen where Wilhelmina had been murdered. Winston studied the eerie photographs of the scene, the brightly lit kitchen contrasted with the grim presence of a crossbow.\n\nShaking his head to focus, Winston remembered his visit to Nicole's home. Her exclusive medieval-themed art pieces took his breath away, as did her pride. \"My treasures,\" she beamed, pointing grandly to a display case which held a pristine medieval crossbow.\n\nA memory tugged at his mind, it wasn't just the crossbow she was proud of. He recalled a discussion with a bartender, the mention of Nicole's frequent appearances at medieval art auctions. What's more, Nicole had been known to read books on crossbows, and there were even whispers among her acquaintances of her crossbow-shooting practices.\n\nAnd then there were the rumors, dark whispers that followed Nicole like a specter. It seemed that almost everyone Nicole had been friendly with had died under mysterious circumstances, the very circumstances that were all too familiar to Winston as he studied the police records. \n\nToo many puzzle pieces, yet somehow connected. Even the seemingly mundane receipt Winston held in his hand felt like a silent hint. Nicole had gone grocery shopping recently and had the forethought to buy the deceased's favorite snacks, her groceries for the day when she'd stayed home, and which now lay untouched on the granite counter.\n\nWinston felt the connection, not clear, yet humming under the surface. What were all these interesting coincidences? Was it pure chance that Nicole collected pieces of art connected to people who lay dead? Or that Wilhelmina, a renowned collector of medieval artifacts including crossbows, was found by a crossbow in her friend's kitchen, a friend who had somehow acquired an authentic crossbow as part of her art collection and stayed home all day?\n\nHe picked up the phone, ordered more coffee, and resumed his investigations. An intricate puzzle indeed.\n\nWinston frowned at the laptop screen in front of him, then squinted. A plethora of eBooks on archery and yoga were being sent to Isabelle's inbox, indicating Isabelle received her reading materials digitally. A picture of the cheery-looking Isabelle, beaming next to a massive crossbow, was plastered all over her heavily used social media accounts. The caption boasted of her skills, \"So proud to be part of the city archery club.\" He navigated to a different tab, confirming her membership of an online archery club that used crossbows.\n\nAs he studied her profile, he noted some details in her bio that surprised him slightly. Next to the information that she was a yoga instructor, it read, \"Travel junkie! Always out exploring after each teaching contract!\" She had also listed her LinkedIn, which Winston opened. He grimaced as he skimmed over her numerous long-term contracts in various cities, and her preferred methods of payment were invariably digital.\n\nDetermined to get a clearer picture of Isabelle, he called her up.\n\n“Isabelle, this is Detective Winston. I’d like to ask you a few questions about the death of Wilhelmina. I’d like to meet in person,” he said.\n\n“I’d prefer if we chat online, Detective. I’m more comfortable that way,” she replied, again indicating her strong preference for online communication.\n\nHours later, on a video call, Isabelle appeared composed but slightly guarded. \n\n\"Routine is central to my yoga classes, Detective,\" Isabelle said, and she further explained that her yoga schedule ran like clockwork. The sessions followed a rigid timeslot and it just so happened that the fateful class in Wilhelmina's kitchen took place right around the time of the murder.\n\n\"Wilhelmina was a regular attendee in my classes, and she even offered her kitchen for one of our sessions. She thought the atmosphere would be more inviting,\" Isabelle shared. She paused, seemingly unsure if she should continue. After a beat, she added, \"She was a sweet lady. It's sad to think she was murdered right there...\"\n\nHer voice trailed off, and she looked the detective square in the face, \"I was there, in the kitchen when it happened, but I... I didn’t do anything wrong.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I just finished up a teaching contract in this city and I look forward to exploring this place more, Detective,\" she concluded, a half-smile playing on her lips.\n\nAfter the call ended, Winston sat back in his chair, taking in the conversation. As he switched back to her social media profile, the pictures of her beaming next to her crossbow kept coming back.\n\nA notification chimed, alerting him to a new email from the forensics lab. The report stated that a crossbow could be the murder weapon.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston muttered to himself, eyes flicking back to the beaming image of Isabelle and her crossbow on the screen.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

His next lead, Rachel, had been seen here with the late Samuel not too long ago.\n\nWinston adjusted his hat and proceeded towards the labyrinth's house. According to the intel he had received, Rachel was a tenant and he needed to dig deeper. \n\nAs he was led through the maze-like building, Rachel's familiarity with the structure was made clear to him. She had free access, considering her status as a tenant. \n\nIn the grand living room of the labyrinth, he spotted a collection of many intricate corkscrews casually displayed in a glass cabinet. The officer who had briefed him had mentioned Rachel's eclectic collection, her acknowledged ability to open wine bottles with one and her reputation as a sommelier; a mastery which requires a sophisticated expertise with corkscrews.\n\nLater, as Winston requested an opportunity to talk, Rachel's past encounters with the law were addressed. She had been in cuffs before on account of murder and the homicide detectives at the station had previously linked several victims to Rachel’s unique pattern of killing—using a corkscrew as a weapon, a pattern that was too specific to belong to anyone else but her.\n\nJust as Winston was about to cut through to the quick, he noticed a piece of paper in the corner of Rachel's otherwise neat room. Peering closer, he spotted Samuel's name at the top of the list. It was confirmed - Samuel was on Rachel's list of confirmed victims that matched her cruel corkscrew method.\n\nThen came the disturbing facts; the ones that didn't sit right with Winston. Among them was the undeniable likeness of poor Samuel to Rachel's former victims. Matching to the tee, in fact, to the known victims, who all bore the mark of her corkscrew.\n\n\"Samuel was last seen here, wasn't he?\" Winston asked, which Rachel confirmed. She also admitted that they had entered the labyrinth together.\n\nBut the most chilling revelation for Winston was the fact that no one else was known to have been in the labyrinth. It was just them, Samuel and Rachel. The isolation within the labyrinth had always made it a place of mystery and unease. It was as if the labyrinth in itself was involved in the elaborate dance of death.\n\nAs he departed, Winston wondered why an otherwise forty-something pleasant woman like Rachel, a reputed sommelier, would resort to such chilling activities. But that was the puzzle to solve; the reason for his dogged pursuit of the truth.\n\nDetective Winston leaned against the marble labyrinth walls, picturing the lost Samuel stumbling through, only to find his demise. There was always something eerie about labyrinths. They were designed to lose you. Now, they seemed to encapsulate the mystery that lay before him.\n\nWalking away from the labyrinth, he climbed back into his trusty black Sedan and guided it to Charlotte's studio. He had been told by his colleagues about Charlotte, the celebrated local choreographer. She was reportedly seen distinctively in public places such as shopping malls and parks, with a notepad in her hand, staining the pages fervently as she observed the natural movements of the people around her. She would practice her noted movements again and again until she perfected them for her choreographies.\n\nShe wasn't just famous in the artistic locale of the town, but also a known face in the numerous wine-tasting events around. Her appreciation for fine wine, as was apparent by her regular visits to these soirees, added to her persona. Many would see her, savoring the flavor, discussing the notes and delicacies of the fermented grapes. That's what made her request for him to bring a bottle of red wine in their next meeting less surprising.\n\nThe studio was buzzing as Winston entered. Charlotte was delicately supervising her dancers, commanding the room with a certain grace. As the bass-heavy music dwindled down, he seized the opportunity to gain her attention. “Charlotte?” Winston introduced himself.\n\n\"Detective, please do go ahead and sit,\" Charlotte gestured, quickly excusing herself to handle a delivery that had just arrived. She opened boxes and packages with a certain familiarity, not unusual for someone who received ample parcels daily. What caught his attention; however, was that she was using a corkscrew to slice open the packages. Uncouth, but practical in some way. Never in his line of work had he seen a corkscrew as a package opener.\n\nAs Winston conversed with Charlotte, her defiant love for her sister became evident. There was an uncomfortable history with Samuel where Charlotte's sister played the victim to his harassments. Winston could see the furious protectiveness in Charlotte's eyes as she spoke about her sister's distress under Samuel's provocations\n\n\"We have had this conversation before, Detective,\" Charlotte perched herself on a stool, her excitement dimming into a serious frown. \"I confronted Samuel multiple times about his behavior, and I am not shy about arguing for my sister's protection.”\n\nHer ogle darted around the room before landing back on Winston, glossier. “Can we change the subject?” she pleaded. Sensing her growing discomfort, he agreed and asked about her choreography instead. \n\n“Ah, that’s one of my favorite topics!” She sighed happily, reminiscent of a fine wine savant in a tasting session. \"I observe people's movements in different public places like malls, parks, and even wine-tasting events. I take notes, try them out multiple times until they feel right and incorporate them into my routines. It’s like I’m borrowing from the world and making something beautiful of it,” Her face glowed with dedication, shadowed by an uneasy sadness.\n\nAs Winston prepared to exit the studio, Charlotte requested him for a favor. “Detective, next time you come here, bring a bottle of red along?” A smile painted her lips, gleaming eyes suggesting an implied twinship between the detective and the world of fine wine. “Consider it my fee for the trouble,” she added, chortling softly, her eyes dewy.\n\nAs Winston drove away, he remembered her passion carefully stored in the paper-notes, her love for movements and her wines, and her fiery protection towards her sister. The labyrinth seemed a little less daunting now. Not every turn would lead to a path out, but it was a start.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Charlotte\nB.

It wasn't a pleasant read - Charlotte was hardly a pleasant individual. A chunk of the file was dedicated to dozens of threatening messages Charlotte had sent to Deborah, each one more chilling than the last. It also documented instances where Charlotte had been physically and verbally abusive towards Deborah; hitting her in fits of rage and screaming profanities in her face. \n\nAs he finished the last report, a woman - a shivering woman - approached him. Deborah, the local chauffeur, the singular and exclusive mode of transportation for Charlotte...the woman he had planned to interview next. She was scheduled to pick Charlotte up on the very day the incident had occurred. There wasn't much to her save for the noticeable fear in her eyes and the bruises discreetly hidden under her clothes. \n\nAs he extended a sympathetic greeting to Deborah, he observed her clutching her mobile phone tightly. She always carried her phone with her, a silent reminder of the threatening messages she received. It wasn't in the moment, but quite often did she seem to retreat into it for respite, even mid-conversation. \"The modern security blanket,\" he mused.\n\n\"Deborah, we need to discuss your last interaction with Charlotte,\" he began softly. As he brought up Charlotte's name, he saw Deborah flinch discernibly. There were scars of fear that were still fresh, some of them physical, it seemed, a weathered map of Charlotte's atrocities towards Deborah etched into her psyche and on her body.\n\nPeering up briefly from the ground she had diverted her attention to, she confirmed in a whisper, \"Yes detective, I was the last person to see her alive.\"\n\nWinston, carefully noting Deborah's often downward gaze when discussing anything personal, led her gently into her house, promising to keep any discussion of abuse and threats brief. Even still, she could hardly keep focused. Any query about her encounters with Charlotte was met with a quick detour to safer topics. Winston sympathized; it was rare to come across a victim of abuse unwillfully enmeshed in the circumstances of their abuser.\n\nHer phone buzzed with a new message, and she busily unlocked it, her eyes flickering eagerly for the change in attention. Friends, as Winston noted, often shared her focus with the frequent check of her phone.\n\nA neighbor came by, offering her some comfort as well. Winston observed them interact - the perfect chance to bring up the witnessed incidents of abuse. From overheard insults to the occasional audible thud coming from the house when Charlotte would physically lash out, the neighbor painted a grim picture of Deborah's life with Charlotte.\n\nWinston recognized the signs instantly, the clear dread of confrontation, the unwillingness to discuss personal matters. \"It's obvious- she's trapped in an abusive relationship,\" he thought to himself. Deborah's reticence made sense - her life was challenging enough without raking over painful memories.\n\nBut it was clear more than ever - Deborah was cornered. Stranded in a world where she was the victim of Charlotte’s aggression. Her dependence on her mobile phone and career as Charlotte's sole driver showed a desperate attempt to anchor herself to something stable.\n\nSipping his lukewarm coffee, Winston listened more than he talked, realizing just how deep the story ran. In the heart of it was just a simple driver- trapped, abused, and scared. As he left, he hoped in earnest that the case would close soon. There was too much pain left unsaid.\n\nA weary Detective Winston sat in the backseat of the unmarked patrol car, watching the home where Letti was currently residing. He still had questions about the murder of Charlotte, questions that were gnawing at him. \n\nHe remembered speaking with Charlotte's housekeeper who confirmed that earlier that day, Charlotte had invited Letti over for dinner. Witnesses reported seeing Letti enter the victim's house. The housekeeper swore the two of them were alone in the kitchen. It was a space secluded from the rest of the house. Winston chocked it up to Charlotte's need for privacy. \n\nIronically, privacy was something that was now being invaded by the media. They'd been hounding Charlotte, trying to pry the truth out of her. The truth that Letti had possibly wanted to keep in the dark. \n\n\"Charlotte told Letti, 'I know what you did',\" the housekeeper revealed during the interview. Winston wondered whether Charlotte knew something about Letti, something dangerous... something worth killing for. \n\nLetti's reaction to Charlotte's statement, according to the housekeeper, had been intense. \"The outburst... it was as if Letti was cornered or threatened,\" the housekeeper claimed.\n\nAs he went over his notes, Winston's thoughts wandered to the security footage he had seen earlier. It was from a pawn shop, a shady establishment known to sell stun guns. The grainy footage dated back to earlier that day showed a woman matching Letti's description. The Pawn Shop's owner confirmed that she'd bought a stun gun.\n\nLetti had been taking self-defense classes. After seeing footage from her at a concert, Winston knew Letti could use a stun gun effectively. She wasn't just a groupie; she was more than what she appeared to be, a fact that was becoming painfully clear. \n\nAfter a few more minutes, Winston made his decision. He needed to talk to Letti. He got out of the car, straightened his jacket, and walked towards the house, every fact etched deep into his mind.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Letti\nB.

He pulled out a crumpled picture of Chloe from his pocket and sighed, replaying the explosion at the movie theatre over and over in his mind, as well as the image of Jake, the man he's spotted Chloe with on numerous clandestine dates.\n\n\"Ruby,\" he began. His voice was low and weary. \"I understand that you and Chloe had planned a sister-courtship to the movies last night.\"\n\nA flicker of surprise crossed Ruby's face. \"Why, yes. Chloe wanted to see that new film, The Scarlet Phoenix. We enjoyed a night at the theater till the very end. Nobody else entered or left the theater during our stay - it was just us.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" muttered Winston. \"And there were eyewitnesses confirming that you were the last person seen with Chloe?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" said Ruby hesitatingly,\"We departed together.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" muttered Winston, making no further comment. Instead, he considered the reported vision of Ruby seeing Chloe kissing another man. Another man who turned out to be Jake.\n\n\"I understand that you might have feelings for Jake. Is that right?\" Winston questioned, watching Ruby carefully.\n\nRuby hesitated, playing with the locket around her neck. “Yes, I suppose that's true,” she admitted, but never meeting his gaze.\n\nThe detective changed the angle of the conversation. “I've heard tales about your psychic abilities, Ruby. You tend to see dangerous things. Your visions included dreadful bomb scenarios back when you were in the military, right?”\n\n\"I've had visions,\" Ruby replied defensively. \"Visions are often ambiguous. They can symbolize various scenarios. I did see Chloe, Chloe kissing another man... Jake. And yes, during my service, I’ve seen how war and destruction unfold, even how to use grenades.\"\n\n\"I can imagine,\" Winston said, thinking to himself. Connecting the dots, he continued, \"Did you know that Jake and Chloe were secretly seeing each other?\"\n\nRuby's apprehension told Winston everything he needed to know. \"Yes, I knew. Chloe told me about it,\" she said, her face growing pale.\n\n\"Did you also stay behind after the movie, in the theatre?\" Winston asked, looking at Ruby sternly.\n\n\"We both enjoyed the ending credits music, so we stayed till the end. I distinctly remember walking out of the theatre last night, but... alone,\" Ruby said, hinting at her absence following the movie's completion.\n\nWinston allowed a moment's pause before continuing on. \"Ruby, where did you go after the movie ended?\"\n\n\"I went to my brother's house,\" Ruby's reply was swift, a touch too swift.\n\nWinston blinked, remembering her brother's notorious reputation as an arms dealer, and Ruby's own military background. \"That's... convenient.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is,\" Ruby replied quietly, eyes fixed on the policeman's tired, yet zealous gaze. The meeting was concluded with that, leaving Winston with the chilling evening wind and another lead in Chloe's puzzling demise.\n\nWinston glanced at the movie ticket stub Roscoe held, noting that it was for the same film as Chloe. He squinted at Roscoe, who was a respected astrophysicist and dedicated military officer, but his current disheveled appearance suggested a disconnect. \n\n\"You were here at the theatre when the event happened, then?\" Winston asked, gesturing at the ticket. Roscoe was indeed there before the movie started, now confirmed by the timing on his ticket. \n\nA confirmed nod came from Roscoe, who avoided meeting Winston’s gaze. \"Yeah, I was here. Same movie as her.\" His voice dropped lower. \"When the incident occurred during the movie screening. Chloe... She didn't make it.\"\n\nWinston hesitated, knowing Chloe's death wasn't the only thing he needed to discuss today. Throughout their conversation, Winston noticed a limp in Roscoe's step, bruises, and a sharp wince when he moved a certain way. \"Looks like you've got some injuries there,\" Winston remarked casually. \n\nThough he spoke offhandedly, Roscoe was quick to brush it off, often changing the subject when questioned about his injuries, which drew Winston’s attention. More so than before, Winston observed, people tended to notice when someone was deliberately avoiding a topic.\n\nTrying not to push too far, Winston paused momentarily - but then he remembered the drug bag found in Roscoe’s possession at the theater. He recalled a report from resident neighbors as well, Mr. & Mrs. Davenport, stating that they've often seen Roscoe limping into his apartment late in the night, disheveled and pained. Further arousing suspicion was the doorman’s testimony, reporting a similar disheveled state during the late-night arrivals.\n\nRemaining cognizant of the consequences to Roscoe’s military career if he were to be caught using drugs, Winston pressed on, \"Roscoe, I've heard you've been behaviorally inconsistent at work lately. And there’s the matter of the confiscated drug bag. Do you understand the negative implications this could have for your military career?\"\n\nRoscoe visibly flinched. His demeanor took on a nervous edge, scratching his arm as it often did when he felt cornered. Winston’s gaze hardened, feeling certain that Roscoe was the name written in secret within Chloe's notebook. The one she intended to report for drug usage.\n\n“I...uh got to use the restroom,\" Roscoe stammered before rushing off, undoubtedly the effects of the drugs kicking in.\n\nWinston decided to follow, needing more answers. Was Roscoe the reason behind Chloe's demise? Was this why he'd jeopardize a promising military career with drug addiction? With renewed determination, Winston set off after him.\n\nAs Winston neared the restroom, he was eerily reminded of the nearly empty crime scene — a movie theatre mid-showing. He shuddered at the thought of the panic that ensued when the grenade went off during the screening.\n\nBut there was no time for that now, he had a suspect to confront.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

But nevertheless he walked through the city park, talking with some locals there on their morning strolls. He was investigating the death of a young woman, Bria, found dead—yes, here—in these park grounds days before.\n\nHis steps took him to the park’s community center, a hub that also served as a point of supply for the various camps around the city. The center stored tools such as hatchets for outdoor activities, usually deployed during camping. He made his way to the office of Naomi, an intern there working specifically with these tools. Naomi taught camping skills not only at the center but also at the camps. She taught how to swing a hatchet, how to build a fire, and overall, how to survive in the wilderness.\n\nWinston knocked, and Naomi opened the door. Winston noticed bandages on her hands.\n\n“Hello, Naomi,” Winston said, “I understand that you knew Bria?”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “We knew each other. She… she was very violent towards me.”\n\n“Violent how?”\n\n“She, uhm… she assaulted me. Several times. I reported her violent behavior multiple times to the police. I was even granted a restraining order against her... at least I had…”\n\nThe words hung in the air. “I was even hospitalized once because of her. All the time, I felt jeopardized by her continuous attacks” \n\n“And Bria, she was here the day she was murdered?”\n\n“I was told she was planning to be here that day, yes. On the same day, I was leading an outdoor skills class. And it was indeed a strange coincidence, I was teaching people how to use a hatchet for chopping wood.”\n\n“A coincidence,” Winston repeated, looking at the bandages on Naomi’s hands again. Then, without a word more, Winston turned and left. He had more people to talk to, and more questions to ask.\n\nWinston flicked his cigarette lighter close, producing a small gust of smoke. The case was still in its initial stages, but he had already pieced together some revealing tidbits. He scrawled on the desk all he knew about a woman named Serenity - the prime suspect.\n\nHe'd first heard about her from a group who camped locally. It was their regular outing spot, they'd told him. \"Serenity is always with us.. always got her hatchet in tow. We've seen her use it - she knows what she's doing,\" they'd mentioned while sharing tales of their outings.\n\nWinston had kept the group to the side and decided to pay a visit to Serenity's home. As he'd approached her home, he'd noticed something unusual about her - her fascination with bugs. Every room was filled with display cases containing various insects, some of them rarely seen in their town. He'd even observed several of those he recognized to be rare and expensive. From what he could see, she had made significant investments to procure and preserve her insect collection, hinting at her large expenses in preserving the rare insects.\n\nHer routine was also centered around these creatures. Apparently, she frequented the library often, particularly the entomology section. In fact, the library's records showed that she had checked out several books on insects.\n\nWhat added to all this was a piece of evidence that Winston couldn't shake off - a letter from the victim. It had been addressed to Serenity, with Bria explicitly mentioning her intentions to testify. The letter revealed Bria's possession of damaging information regarding Serenity's singular, and highly illegal, practices in insect collection and preservation.\n\nAs he visited the library for some more information, a clerk had passed him an interesting insight. \"That girl Serenity? Always in the insect section – with her hatchet, too. Sharpens it while reading, she does.\"\n\nWinston returned to his table with his thoughts. As he flipped through the pages of notes, he came upon a second revelation about Serenity's newfound predicament. After corroborating with several of Bria's friends, Winston learned that Bria had confided in them about her decision to testify against Serenity. The information Bria had was extremely serious, which could lead to dire consequences for Serenity.\n\nStrengthening his suspicion was one piece of evidence echoing in his mind – a hatchet, freshly used and confiscated from Serenity that eerily matched the deadly weapon at the crime scene. Forensic reports confirmed that the blood and ridges of the hatchet were an exact match to the murder weapon at park, tightening his grip on Serenity. Winston could see the connecting dots, but the fear of jumping to conclusions had his caution wobbling on a thin thread.\n\nThe day may have ended, but the case had only just begun.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Randy was a tall, thin man with a head of unruly hair, loosely holding onto a crushed, rather worn looking guitar pick. Seemed like a regular musician, but Winston knew that eyes can deceive. He started the conversation, coaxing out bits and pieces of Randy's most recent trials. \n\n\"Rumor has it you're having some trouble paying off loans, Randy,\" Winston ventured. \n\nThe musician looked up from his plate, setting his fork down. \"Yeah, you heard right,\" Randy confessed. \n\nWinston waited a beat, then asked, \"Got any other vices we should know about?\"\n\nRandy chuckled grimly. \"Well, I have a knack for getting my money into the wrong hands at the poker table.\"\n\nWinston nodded, making a note of it. Before moving onto the next subject, he specified, \"Got news yesterday - a revolver was found, identical to the one you were seen with at a music concert. It turned out to be the murder weapon.\" \n\nRandy paused and shrugged. \"Got it for protection. You never know who you might run into on the road. I only ever use it for shooting at the range.\"\n\nWhilst Randy was talking, Winston noticed the deep scars on Randy's fingers in the dim neon light. They were all identical in their presence, all etched with the same depth and characteristics. Being a man of detail, Winston asked Randy about them.\n\n\"Those?\" Randy looked at his hands with a sad laughter. \"Each scar on my hand came from a different guitar string breaking at a concert, all of them had a unique tale to tell,\" he said. Then he added, \"usual guitar injuries are just mere blisters, not deep scars like these. But what can I say? Bad luck follows me around\".\n\nWinston, though intrigued, refrained from reading anything into it. He then moved the conversation toward Randy's past interactions with the victim, the international hotel mogul, Jimmy.\n\n“So you knew Jimmy. The guy owned hotels from Tokyo to New York,” Winston stated.\n\n\"Jimmy, he loved his opulence. Always surrounded by luxury,\" Randy shrugged. \"Not that I ever got a slice of it, of course. I played in a few of his hotels... never got the invite to the penthouse.\" \n\nWinston thanked Randy for his time and left the diner. There were more aspects of this case to sniff out. All in a day’s work.\n\nDetective Winston sat across from Isla at the local coffee shop, the smell of burnt coffee wafting around them. \n\nIsla played less of a nervous suspect and leaned more into her usual friendly demeanor. Although they usually ran into each other at the gym, today's meetup was not about catching up on fitness routines. Just the other day, she had confessed to a friend on the treadmill beside her that she couldn't bear the blackmail from Jimmy anymore.\n\n\"Jimmy...he...he was blackmailing me, Detective Winston,\" Isla confessed, bleakly stirring her coffee. Her hopelessness was clear, something she had mentioned to her friends recently regarding the relentless blackmail. \n\nWinston didn't show his surprise. He just nodded and gestured for her to continue. \n\n\"We used to meet at a motel down the road. Crazy, right? But it was the only place we could talk without being seen. I was even there on the day of the murder,\" Isla confessed. That fact was uncovered in a police report which witnessed Isla at the motel on the day of Jimmy's murder.\n\nWinston knew this already, having received a report of Isla being spotted with Jimmy at the motel quite a few times in the past. He just grunted, encouraging her to keep speaking. \n\n\"It's not what you think. He...he took some photos...and threatened to expose them.\" Isla shuddered, her coffee cup rattling in her hand. \n\n\"Did you ever confront him about it?\" Winston asked, looking unwaveringly at Isla. \n\n\"Yes, I did! I couldn't stand it any longer, Detective. That day...the day he was killed...I was going to tell him it had to stop,\" Isla admitted, her voice raw with emotion. \n\n\"And then what happened?\" Winston asked, watching Isla's face carefully. \n\n\"I...I don't remember,\" Isla said, running a hand through her hair. \"I was so worked up. I just...I ended up at the shooting range. It helps...calm me down.\"\n\nWinston groaned internally on hearing this. Isla had been seen at the shooting range more often than not lately, supposedly to \"blow off some steam\". On one occasion, she had talked extensively about her growing gun collection to another gym buddy, which was a recurring topic she loved to discuss with anyone who'd lend an ear. She was often heard discussing different types of firearms amidst these conversations. \n\n\"Do you remember what time it was when you left the range?\" Winston asked. But Isla shook her head, looking gloomy, and didn't say a word. \n\nWinston sighed and checked his watch. The interview was close to being over, and he needed to gather more facts to help solve the case. But in the back of his mind, he couldn't help but dwell on the circumstances... Hopeless. Desperate. A lineup of damning coincidences. But the one most nagging thought that lingered as he got up to leave was the overpowering scent of burnt coffee: just how much it reminded him of gunpowder.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

His next interview would be with Samuel, the paramedic who had attended to their deceased and who was, unfortunately, on duty that day of the murder.\n\nWinston drove to the medical supply store, where his potential suspect was apparently employed. He found Samuel scrubbing down the glass doors of the facility, glimpsing the red-cross logo stitched on his uniform shoulder.\n\n\"Samuel?\" Winston queried, getting out of his car. \n\n“Yeah, that’s me,\" came the tired response. Samuel looked up from his task, tossing a quick glance at the detective’s badge.\n\n“My name’s Detective Winston. I need to speak with you about a few things. Mind if we step inside?” \n\n“Sure, detective,” Samuel gestured toward the main entrance and Winston followed. \n\nOnce inside, Samuel's persona changed. Winston noticed the way he moved around the shelves, the confidence in his steps. The paramedic knew his way around medical supplies. His extensive training had equipped him with the knowledge to deal with a variety of emergency situations, including trauma inflicted by barbed wire.\n\nA jangling of keys pulled Winston's attention back to Samuel. He was unlocking a storage unit near the far end of the store, revealing shelves lined with a variety of products, including a roll of barbed wire. \n\n\"Just restocking,\" Samuel explained, but Detective Winston made no response - it wasn't his place to draw conclusions. He pulled out his small notebook from his back pocket, jotting down a few insignificant details before closing it again.\n\nLater that day, Winston visited Isolde’s workspace, noting the appointment book left open on her desk. It showed a visit from Samuel penciled in at a noontime slot, the same day Isolde was murdered. \n\nBuried under the papers on Isolde's desk, the detective found a DVD labeled \"Surgical Errors,\" - the video evidence of Samuel's medical malpractice. It was clear Isolde had been collecting her evidence against Samuel.\n\nHe next met with Isolde’s secretary, who was visibly shaken. \"Yes, Detective. I remember confirming Samuel’s appointment.\" she mentioned, “I believe it was his medical review?\"\n\nWinston nodded, making no comment. He reflected upon the video evidence he had found at Isolde’s office. The recording that allegedly held evidence of Samuel's botched surgery had now become more significant.\n\nHe returned back to his car, pondering over the details of Samuel's superior who had warned him about the potential job loss and jail time, given his recent errors. \n\nHis last snippet of information had come from a security guard at Isolde's building who had seen Samuel entering her office on the day of the murder.\n\nWinston felt the familiar burn of an overworked mind. But he kept his thoughts at bay as he rounded out his day. The puzzle pieces were often murky, and their connections circumstantial. His job was to find them, and affix them one by one until the whole image revealed itself.\n\nWinston was staring at his murky reflection in the last few drops of coffee. Isolde was dead, strangled in her home office, possibly by her roommate and partner in crime, Bernard. Together, Bernard and Isolde were involved in some mystifying activities, being partners in their dubious affairs while sharing the same living space. \n\nWinston sighed and thought to his next interview, Bernard. He was next on Winston's list. Known as a cattle rancher in town, Bernard made his living through the ranching business. He was also known for his suspiciously close relationship with Isolde, as they not only shared a living area but were partners in crime.\n\nUpon entering the ranch, Winston noticed Bernard wearing a rugged cowboy hat and a pair of gloves, trying to fix a broken fence. Intriguingly, there was no barbed wire in sight, an important element for a ranch fence. Winston had received a report about missing barbed wire from this very ranch, and here, he was staring at an opened box that should have contained barbed wires for the fence. \n\nOver a bitter cup of coffee, Winston began his inquiries. \"Heard about your Halloween contest victory, Bernard. Hannibal Lecter impersonation, was it?\" \n\nBernard smiled, his eyes glinting, \"Oh yeah, good times. Did an Anthony Perkins one at the last party too, from Psycho.\" Many at the party overheard Bernard reciting Anthony Perkins' lines with unnerving accuracy.\n\nWinston thought about the strangeness of the situation, a man so obsessed with horror and thrillers, impersonating characters from such genre. Bernard might have been telling the truth, but it was part of Winston's job to consider all possibilities.\n\nBernard happily divulged how he frequently visits speciality stores to buy all kinds of horror and thriller movies. His eyes lit up with excitement as he spoke about his dedicated room for his extensive movie collection, featuring an array of thrillers with Anthony Perkins' Psycho as the crown jewel.\n\nWhen Winston asked Bernard for an alibi on the night of Isolde's murder, Bernard reaffirmed he didn't invite anyone else and that he was home alone that night. No neighbors reported any visitors to his residence during the time of the crime. Winston asked Bernard if he noticed anything out of the ordinary during that time, to which Bernard looked puzzled and shook his head.\n\nWinston finished his coffee and made his way towards the door. As he left Bernard's ranch, he noted the puzzling absence of the barbed wire from the fences, Bernard's conspicuous enthusiasm for horror characters, and the deafening silence from the neighbors about any missing barbed wire. The picture was becoming clearer. What conclusions these facts would lead to, that was for a later time. For now, he had to focus on gathering more crucial facts and information about the suspicious circumstances surrounding Isolde's death.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Stuart had been a wise man with a taste for danger - deadly danger as it turned out. It was only late afternoon when he met his untimely end, just as banks were closing for the day. Now it seemed Winston would have to sink into the corrupt underbelly of banking and finance. His first port of call was Lowell, a banker with more than just saving bonds under his watch. \n\nWinston wandered into the tall, imposing building of the First National Bank, not far from the brutally ironic tourist attraction that was the zoo. As the day ebbs away, these hallowed corporate walls began to shut their operations until another day of profiteering began. A fitting time, Winston thought, as he ascended the escalator towards the suspect's office. \n\n\"Are you Lowell?\", Winston inquired to the man hunched over the computer. Lowell acknowledged without tearing his eyes from the screen. Winston could see Lowell’s notebook on his desk with tabs categorized for each individual person he interacts with, highlighting his meticulous note-taking approach during personal conversations with his clients. On his computer, screens were filled with multiple conversation tabs open at once. \n\nOn his way out, he ran into the cleaning person. \"You know, I always wondered what our banker friend here does till so late. Always working on something, his office window shining bright blue even at night\", the cleaner mentioned casually; substantiating that employees have been noticing Lowell spending long hours on the bank's computer system.\n\nWinston took a quick detour on his way back to the precinct. He stopped at the café, not more than five minutes from the zoo. A barista recognized Lowell's photo and mentioned that he was, indeed, around the café at the time of Stuart’s murder. \n\nThe following day, Winston was handed an unexpected gift. Lowell's laptop, turned over by none other than the deceased Stuart, was found. Stuart had found evidence of Lowell's fraudulent dealings scribbled in meticulous notes on his laptop. Not only did this prove Stuart's knowledge of Lowell’s covert operations, it led to Stuart starting to demand money from Lowell in exchange for his silence. Emails recovered from Stuart riddled of a cryptic conversation between Stuart and an anonymous source, discussing Lowell's illicit activities. \n\nBefore heading home, Winston made one last stop. Lowell had mentioned a bank meeting earlier that day. The meeting had been in one of the bank's private buildings located near the zoo, verifying Lowell’s business with a bank which was near to the zoo. \n\nIt seemed that Lowell's deliberate and meticulous work in the bank was becoming clearer to Winston, but there was still much more to discover about the financial operative’s involvement in Stuart's untimely demise.\n\nIt was a pleasant day as Winston swaggered into the bustling cafe brimming with caffeine-seekers. The rich aroma of freshly ground coffee filled the air, almost disguising the sporadic clinking noises piercing through the grind. However, to Winston's keen eye, one barista stood out - a young woman named Xanthe, skillfully pulling espresso shots while polishing an object, small enough to fit into a coat pocket, but its oddly shaped curvature glinted under the café's warm lights. \n\nA casual inquiry revealed it to be a hatchet, notably small and easily concealable, an unusual prop among the coffee mugs and espresso machines. \"Could you tell me more about your interest in wood carving, Xanthe?\" Winston posed his question over a steaming cup of coffee.\n\nWith a gleaming smile, Xanthe responded, \"It's a hobby I've had for over ten years now. You never know when a good piece of wood may come by, so I always keeps my small hatchet handy, easy to slide into a bag or coat when I am on the move.\"\n\nWinston tipped his head in understanding as he sipped the expertly brewed espresso. He'd learned that Xanthe’s work schedule included weekends, the same routine followed by the victim, Stuart. Apparently, Stuart used to frequent this cafe every day after his regular visit to the zoo. Often seen sharing laughs with the other baristas, the friendly banter always caught Winston's eye. After chatting with Stewart's favorite barista, Winston was informed that Xanthe often went beyond the call of service by making Stewart's favorite signature drinks, even providing them with a certain uniqueness.\n\nHowever, recently, there had been changes in Stuart’s behaviors and tastes. A barista friend informed Winston that Stuart had been increasingly engaging with a new barista, a certain Mary, who’d started to share Xanthe's place as his favored barista. In fact, Stuart could often be overheard praising Mary's special blend, words that returned a comforting smile to Mary's face.\n\nTaking in this new pool of information, Winston thanked Xanthe and exited the café, soon reaching the location of the crime, the zoo. The zoo’s visitation logs confirmed that Stuart had indeed visited every day, including the unfortunate weekend he had met his unfortunate end.\n\nThe visit to the café and the zoo left Winston reflective. It was not a simple case, it seemed. Each action involved ordinary routines, hobbies, and work, yet suddenly thrust into a deadly mix. The sharpened hatchet, small and concealable, she so casually carried seemed more prominent in his mind now - the murder weapon in question.\n\nIt was a tool so commonplace in woodcarving, so easily concealed, that it could move about almost unobtrusively. True, it was an impromptu visit to the zoo, where routine unraveled into chaos that had cinched his focus onto Xanthe. These seemingly unrelated actions now carried an underlying trail to unravel, one that was wound around with routine, work, hobbies, and a simple hatchet.\n\nYet, his job was to collect the facts, not deduce. There were many roads to follow, many leads to consider before they held weight, before they could be linked definitively to the crime. That was a puzzle that was yet to be put together, a mystery that was yet to be unfolded. Until then, he had only facts and his coffee, both strong and bitter, demanding attention to detail. Winston downed the last swig, feeling the potent caffeine lining his senses, ready for the long road ahead.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Xanthe\nB.

He immediately took notice of the intense atmosphere, the air heavy, the shop's occupants quiet. Looking around, he saw Ruben, the owner of the florist's shop, immersed in his work—grinding powder in a mortar, measuring volatile liquids with a dropper, and then mixing it all.\n\n\"Busy I see,\" Winston remarked. \n\nRuben glanced up, his bright green eyes flicking towards a book on the counter. Winston caught sight of the cover, reading 'Veterinary Medicine: An Essential Guide.' Ruben’s passion for learning was no new news. When he wasn't caught up in his flower shop, he was often seen engrossed in text about animal physiology, relating it to his plant biology knowledge.\n\n\"Just preparing the floral preservative mix for tomorrow,\" Ruben said, pointing towards the array of acids lined in front of him. \"Acetic acid, my boy, along with citric and ascorbic acids - they all work wonders for a bouquet.\"\n\n\"You studied Chemistry, I've heard,\" Winston remarked casually.\n\nRuben smiled at this. \"You need a sense for it in my line of work - keep the flowers fresh and so on. He peered at the detective over vintage spectacles, \"We're a lot like the plants you know, animals. From the way we grow to the way we die. There's beauty in knowing the biology of it all.\"\n\nWinston nodded, trying not to seem too interested. He noticed a customer coming out of the shop, a red rose in one hand with a distinct feather stuck to its stem - a feather lifelike, seemingly belonging to a bird species widely used in taxidermy.\n\nRuben's eyes lit up. \"A bird feather, eh? Quite interesting.”\n\nWinston didn't respond, simply turned to scan the shop, his eyes falling on a young girl huddled in a corner, eyes red with recent tears. That, he knew, was Ruben's niece. Word had reached him about the threats she'd received from a certain Henry, along with reports of Henry's inappropriate behavior toward her. It appeared to have escalated lately, visibly taking a toll on the poor girl.\n\nRuben noticed Winston’s gaze. “That’s my niece. She’s had a tough time of late.\" His words were somber, \"We've had to handle some... unpleasantness. Threats from Henry, not to mention his behavior toward her...\"\n\n\"Inappropriate behavior?\" Winston asked, seeking confirmation.\n\nRuben nodded before sighing deeply. \"Yes. That man had been threatening her, you know. His words, his actions... all wrong. Someone had to stand up for her...\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Winston said. He picked up his hat and headed toward the door. As he turned around for one last look, he could see Ruben cleaning some glassware. A variety of corrosive chemicals, all meticulously labeled and aligned, surrounded him.\n\nWinston leaned back in the shabby chair, hands folded, and stared unblinkingly across the table. Under the dismal light sat Michael, an archaeologist infamous for his carefree treatment of dangerous substances at the workspace. Michael was known for his reckless use of acid, a skill trained meticulously during his years at the archaeology institute studying the safe handling and disposing of dangerous substances. But he took this to a detrimental level, often taking home acid from work for his own personal use, much to people’s horror.\n\nMichael was no stranger to trouble at work as well. He had been caught multiple times not only irresponsibly handling acid, but also indulging in drug use - specifically heroin. His frequent use often rendered him in states of significant intoxication.\n\n\"The vineyard incident, you were there Michael? Specifically in the secluded part where you had invited Henry to meet?\" Winston asked.\n\nMichael seemed surprised by the question but quickly regained composure. \"Yes, I had invited Henry for a stroll around the secluded part of the vineyard. We crossed paths there quite regularly.\"\n\n\"Henry...\" Winston whispered. Unfortunately, Henry wasn't just any other man for Michael. Henry's lifeless body was discovered soon after their encounter at the vineyard, right in the secluded area where Michael had invited him and where they were known to frequent.\n\n\"And you've used acid at work for artifact cleaning, right? Even took liberties to use it inappropriately?\" Winston pried further.\n\n\"Yes,\" Michael replied curtly, with an ironic smile clinging to his face, “Taking it for a stroll from work to home wasn’t the best idea.”\n\nWinston grunted, his gaze shifting to the visible injection marks on the man's arms. “You’ve been caught using heroin, haven’t you, Michael?”\n\nMichael, almost seeming to read Winston’s thought, confessed, \"Yes, heroin is my problem. Been caught for it more times than I can count.\"\n\n\"But it wasn't only your problem, was it, Michael? Henry... he knew and threatened to expose you,” Winston stated matter-of-factly.\n\nMichael's confidence waivered. He stuttered, “Yeah... He did. He was going to tell everyone.”\n\n\"On records, you have intense training in handling acid and other substances,” Winston pointed out, “At the vineyard too, nobody saw you leave from the secluded part.\"\n\nMichael fell silent. Fear was visible in his eyes. His hands clenched tightly into fists.\n\nStanding up from the table, Winston concluded, “Looks like that day has cost you a lot, hasn’t it?”\n\nFor the first time, Michael's often intoxicated demeanor receded, replaced by a sobering silence.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

The crime scene was hauntingly silent, yet William could still faintly hear the echoes of a crowd, a crowd that once chanted their names. He gazed at the trident left behind. It wasn't common fare in a wrestling ring, but it had historians agreeing of its gladiatorial significance, as it was a commonly used weapon in gladiatorial combat, a whisper of a different time.\n\nHe drove to meet Harper, his only credible lead so far. As Winston pulled up in front of Harper’s residence, her neighbours had only warm greetings for her. 'Ms. Olivia is so well-mannered, a real beacon to our community,' one old man mused with a smile.\n\n“Ms. Olivia?” Winston asked, stepping forward with an extended hand, deciding to go straight to the point, “Did you hear about Isabelle?”\n\n“Yes, a tragedy…” Harper replied, her eyes dodging his, evasively looking around, \"Isabelle... She threatened to uncover something...\" Her voice trailed off and her face was etched with tangible fear. It was clear that Harper was terrified of Isabelle's threat to expose her.\n\n“You were part of a local gladiator reenactment group, weren’t you?” Winston probed, aware from his sources that the group required serious physical preparation and training. Winston glanced at Harper’s tough physique; it made sense. He then gazed at the array of replica gladiatorial weapons displayed on the shelves behind Harper. She nodded rather reluctantly without saying a word.\n\nWinston, changing the topic, asked, “I hear your fascination with crime stretches beyond just books?”\n\nAfter a pause, Harper admitted, “Yes, I enjoy books about crime – a morbid fascination, you could say. The bookstore clerk sees me often, buying many crime novels. The members of my book club and I often have lively debates on forensics too.”\n\nConsidering her confession, Winston made a mental note to check the bookstore. Upon consultation with the local bookstore clerk, it was confirmed that Harper was a frequenter. She had been spotted buying novels from the true crime section multiple times.\n\nAccording to his sources, Isabelle knew Harper had been involved in some kind of illegal activities. In fact, the twisted secret that Isabelle threatened to reveal involved Harper’s clandestine dealings. \n\nBefore leaving, he remembered Harper rolling up her sleeves to shake his hand, and a retrospective glimpse of her physique leaving no doubt about the extensive physical conditioning she must undergo for her stash of staged battles, yet another piece of potential insight into the power and strength that Harper wielded. The pieces were beginning to fit into place, scattered fragments of a life lived under the radar.\n\nWinston pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to stave off the oncoming headache as he sifted through numerous witness statements. His mind kept coming back to one name: Lance. \n\nIsabelle and this Lance fellow were often seen together with Lance referring to her as his wife. But according to what several sources corroborated, Isabelle had mentioned to a close friend, while in earshot of Lance, that she was planning on divorcing him. Lance had not been coy about admitting that he had indeed overheard this conversation.\n\nWinston's weary eyes moved towards the photos of the crime scene. The wrestling ring, normally throbbing with life, seemed void in the ominous light of the flash. Isabelle's life had ended here, in the very wrestling ring that was part of the event Lance was directing.\n\nAs he looked closely at a photo of the bloodied mat, his eyes drifted to a piece of prop laying just out of the boundary of the ring. Lance and his crew handled these props, and Lance himself had been seen practicing with props similar to the one near the crime scene - a trident. He knew Lance had a penchant for ancient weapons, often seen studying or collecting them. It seemed these props were more than just set dressing to Lance.\n\nWinston scratched his chin, pondering. Lance's life revolved around his shows. He loved directing them. This wrestling match, the scene of the crime, was one such event he was in charge of.\n\nWith a final sigh, the detective gathered his things. There still was much left to uncover. Soon after, he found himself in the production area of the show, meeting with Lance.\n\n\"Lance, I presume?\" Winston asked, offering a hand. The man nodded, taking Winston's hand into a firm grip.\n\n\"Winston. I'm... I'm here about your wife, Isabelle.\"\n\nLance's eyes clouded over for a second before he pushed past the emotions, \"Let's talk then, detective.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

He leaned back, studying the sheet of information about Stacey, a known hiker, who had a unique interest in poison dart frogs. \n\nGlancing at Stacey's social media profile, he noticed posts about her numerous trips to the forests populated with these amphibians. Winston found himself flicking through various posts: an essay on the diet of poison dart frogs, vacation videos of her trips, and pictures of her hiking in the rainforest. \n\nDuring his investigation, he discovered that Stacey owned a collection of true crime documentaries. She spent much of her free time watching these documentaries, studying each event meticulously. Winston found it interesting to note that she discussed particular details from her notes with her friends during their local meetings. \n\nNext, he found a pet store receipt. A local pet store clerk had confirmed that Stacey had recently bought an unusual pet: a poison dart frog, one of the most venomous amphibians in the world.\n\nShe was also a former skater, well-known for her unique skating design which she seemed to have stopped after a certain point. He found some pictures of her in mid-flight, her moves elegant and effortless. \n\nConversations had been had about a particular incident involving Roxanne, the victim. It seemed Roxanne’s rise to fame came shortly after Stacey stopped skating. It was public knowledge that Roxanne's sensational success was off the back of what appeared to be Stacey’s unique style. \n\nThere was also talk about how Stacey faced ridicule from friends and acquaintances who used to adore her designs. Roxanne had managed to outshine her, using Stacey’s ideas for personal gain for which she took all the credit.\n\nWinston closed his notebook, sighing deeply, and flicked off the lamp light. The pieces of the puzzle began to form a picture, but for now, the detective had to report back to headquarters, leaving the specimen under a magnifying glass, awaiting further analysis.\n\nSquinting against the harsh sunlight, Detective Winston strolled through the bustling skate park frequently visited by both Hector and his victim, Roxanne. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a casually dressed man sitting on a wooden ramp, Hector.\n\nHector was a flight attendant, an occupation that requires frequent travel. Lately, his route was often to South America, a realm teeming with a wide range of amphibian species, including a certain frog species that produces lethal poison. Winston discovered this after studying his flight records which showed multiple trips to countries renowned for their amphibian diversity. He had no accountable alibi during the time of the murder. Despite the demanding schedule, he maintained a remarkable career in the industry.\n\n\"Hello, Hector,\" Winston greeted, careful not to reveal an ounce of suspicion.\n\n\"Oh! Detective Winston,\" Hector replied, appearing taken aback. \"What brings you here?\"\n\n\"Just passing through,\" Winston shrugged, casually observing the adrenaline-fueled stunts coming to life around them.\n\n\" I see,\" Hector's eyes followed Winston's gaze. \"I often come here, it's a good distraction,\" he added, something approaching regret marring his features. Hector then mentioned his usual habit, \"Whenever I come here, I always sign-in at the reception. Did the same on the day of the murder and thereafter stayed around the vicinity of the crime scene.\"\n\n\"I heard,\" Winston nodded, gliding his fingers over the smooth, worn-out surface of the ramp.\n\nA peculiar thing about Hector was his educational background. He wasn't initially an aviation enthusiast; rather, he had a degree in biology, specifically amphibians.\n\n\"You studied frogs in school, didn't you?\" Winston casually dropped the question, forcing himself not to observe Hector closely.\n\n\"Yes, that's right. Interesting creatures, they are. Lots of them in South America too,\" Hector affirmed with an enthusiastic nod. Winston noticed how he specifically mentioned the frogs, especially those indigenous to South America.\n\nThe chill of the evening began to set in, just as their presence near the crime scene did. This park was just a stone's throw away from where Roxanne, a promising young soul, met her untimely end due to a peculiar poison – derived from a specific frog, found solely in South America.\n\nWith this in the back of his mind, Winston focused back on Hector. He and Roxanne had history. A romantic history, to be precise. However, their affair was on the verge of exposure —Roxanne had threatened to tell Hector's wife about their infidelity. On the day Roxanne died, Hector, having no accountable alibi, had signed in at this very skate park.\n\n\"Well, Hector, it got colder. Time I get back home,\" Winston said, pushing away from the ramp. He left Hector sitting behind in the growing shadows, thinking about every fact he'd just learnt.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Stacey\nB.
