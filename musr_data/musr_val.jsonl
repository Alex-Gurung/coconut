He grimaced as his gaze landed on the katana. This was not a run-of-the-mill crime; it was seemingly conducted with a professional touch.\n\nBringing himself back from the troubling images, he turned his attention to Isabelle. As Lola's life coach, she could potentially shed some light on the complexities surrounding her death. \n\nFlicking novel-like through an accumulation of notes, he discovered that Isabelle was not as open as most coaches. She engaged with her clients predominantly through privacy-focused platforms and kept any personal details off public forums. The agreement she held with her clients also contained a clause about prioritizing privacy and confiding in her seemed to be one of her requirements, and David --the other man Lola had an affair with-- was no exception. He confided in her, quite frequently as it turned out.\n\nHowever, what caught his attention was a note hinting at her discovery of intimate text messages between Lola and another man. That's why she confided uneasily with David more, ushering them into lengthy personal conversations and extraneous time spent alone. They had far more interactions outside the coaching sessions than was typical.\n\nPulling into Isabelle's driveway, Winston noticed the peace that surrounded her home. Inside, Isabelle waited patiently on an austere chair, a sharp contrast to the decor of the rest of the home.\n\n\"Busy day?\" A plain, professional question to start off with. \n\n\"Indeed. Three sessions at the Dojo and then some client interactions,\" Isabelle replied. \n\n\"Wow, that's a tight routine. At the Dojo, I assume you work with the Katana?\" Winston tried to keep his tone casual.\n\n\"That's correct. I try to keep them in the best condition... sharpening included.\"\n\nHer house was decidedly sparse, but one room was markedly different. A room dedicated to her treasured collection of Katana. Delicate, sharp, deadly works of art.\n\nIsabelle was not one to engage unnecessarily; she had expressed as much. But there was one occasion where she did seem to talk, quite a bit actually. To David.\n\n\"Have you met David outside of the coaching sessions?\" Winston asked, as he examined one of the Katanas. \n\n\"Yes, a few times. Our schedules happen to coincide,\" she responded, her eyes averted.\n\n\"And some of these encounters were in regards to the intimate messages Lola was sharing with the other man?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's correct.\"\n\n\"In connection with Lola, perhaps?\"\n\nIsabelle's gaze hardened. \"Lola was stepping over boundaries - I saw her kissing David.\"\n\nThe session ended with more questions than answers for Winston. He casually bid her goodbye, having established she preferred minimal social interactions.\n\n\"Gotta head back, Isabelle, can't keep the precinct waiting. You have a good day now.\" He put on his hat and walked out, leaving Isabelle with her thoughts.\n\nDetective Winston sat hunched over his quaint oak desk, his dark eyes scanning over the phone records of the deceased, Lola. He jotted down a quick note - Lola had dialed one number numerous times, the number belonging to a certain Frank. It seemed Lola made a habit of contacting him.\n\nHis notes also mentioned that multiple witnesses had recently spotted Frank practicing with his Katanas at a local martial arts studio. His swordsmanship had certainly improved, it showed dedication.\n\nThe following day, Winston found himself driving up the mountain to meet with Frank, a well-respected biologist having an impressive and crucially vital academic career. Frank's workspace was littered with numerous awards and commendations highlighting the value of his work; it was clear that his reputation was important to him.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Frank,\" Detective Winston greeted, extending a hand.\n\nFrank looked up from his microscope and shook the detective's hand, \"Afternoon, detective. What brings you here?\"\n\n\"Lola invited you to her cabin under the semblance of a work retreat, isn't it?\" Winston asked, leaning against the lab desk.\n\n\"Yes,\" Frank replied reluctantly, \"But I never told anyone else about that.\"\n\nWinston nodded and changed the topic, grabbing one of the photos off the table. It was shot a few days ago, Lola and Frank seemed to be in a heated discussion, \"Care to share what this altercation was about?\"\n\n\"Nothing serious, just some professional disagreements,\" Frank dismissed hurriedly, seeming eager to move past the topic.\n\nAs Winston glanced around the room, he noticed something else; A pair of katanas meticulously maintained and displayed on the wall. \"You have an interest in martial arts, Frank?\"\n\nFrank seemed to relax a little, leaning back from the microscope, \"Yes, I've been taking classes recently. It helps me focus.\"\n\n\"And what about these?\" Winston asked, indicating towards the Katanas.\n\n\"Ah those...\" Frank trailed off. \"Well yes, I've been practicing with them, they're my favorite weapon of choice in martial arts,\" he admitted, quickly adding, \"but they're only for practice.\"\n\nWinston headed to the local hardware store after the meeting to confirm another fact. Frank had indeed bought a sharpening stone just a couple of days ago.\n\nAt the end of the day, he checked out Frank's public schedule - it was free on the day Lola got murdered, just as his hunch had indicated. He cross-checked with some bystanders, who also confirmed seeing Frank near the mountain cabin on the same day.\n\nAs Winston wrapped up his day of investigation, he couldn't help but remember the one last crucial piece of information.

What brings you here?\"\n\n\"Lola invited you to her cabin under the semblance of a work retreat, isn't it?\" Winston asked, leaning against the lab desk.\n\n\"Yes,\" Frank replied reluctantly, \"But I never told anyone else about that.\"\n\nWinston nodded and changed the topic, grabbing one of the photos off the table. It was shot a few days ago, Lola and Frank seemed to be in a heated discussion, \"Care to share what this altercation was about?\"\n\n\"Nothing serious, just some professional disagreements,\" Frank dismissed hurriedly, seeming eager to move past the topic.\n\nAs Winston glanced around the room, he noticed something else; A pair of katanas meticulously maintained and displayed on the wall. \"You have an interest in martial arts, Frank?\"\n\nFrank seemed to relax a little, leaning back from the microscope, \"Yes, I've been taking classes recently. It helps me focus.\"\n\n\"And what about these?\" Winston asked, indicating towards the Katanas.\n\n\"Ah those...\" Frank trailed off. \"Well yes, I've been practicing with them, they're my favorite weapon of choice in martial arts,\" he admitted, quickly adding, \"but they're only for practice.\"\n\nWinston headed to the local hardware store after the meeting to confirm another fact. Frank had indeed bought a sharpening stone just a couple of days ago.\n\nAt the end of the day, he checked out Frank's public schedule - it was free on the day Lola got murdered, just as his hunch had indicated. He cross-checked with some bystanders, who also confirmed seeing Frank near the mountain cabin on the same day.\n\nAs Winston wrapped up his day of investigation, he couldn't help but remember the one last crucial piece of information. Lola had been blackmailing Frank with evidence of academic misconduct, tarnishing the career he was so proud of.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Isabelle\nB.

Workers swarmed around an old bulldozer — an earsplitting roar clearly disrupting their conversation.\n\nLeading towards the shade of the makeshift structure, Jose — a construction worker at the scene, caught Winston's eye. His brow was furrowed in worry. Laments about his diminishing performance at work were ripe among his co-workers. Noticing a murder of crows flocking in the field, an eerie feeling washed over Winston.\n\nApproaching the blue-collar worker, Winston kicked-off casually, \"Got a minute, Jose?\"\n\nDrawing a deep breath, Jose turned around to shrug, he seemed a bit frazzled. His friendly banter with his co-workers cut short due to a bulldozer malfunctioning, \"It's an early lunch... not like I was doing much today. My boss caught me chattin' instead of workin'.\"\n\nChuckling, Jose bobbed towards the group of his co-workers, who were noticeably enjoying their conversation. \"We've been going at it round the clock to get that wine store ready. Work's been tough lately, my performance has taken a hit, we gotta vent, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" Winston agreed, casually adding, \"Isn't Terry your boss?\"\n\n\"Technically, yes,\" sighed Jose, rubbing his neck nervously. \"He owns this whole place,\" gesturing around the vineyard. \"We had a... disagreement this morning. He accused me of stealing from the building site, falsifying work hours. Even threatened to fire me.\"\n\nAs Jose's voice trailed off, Winston observed, \"Sounds tough.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Jose replied quietly. \"The man even suspects me for the murder that happened here last week, during my shift. If Terry fires me... everything comes crashing down. This is the main work I've got right now... I can't afford to lose it.\"\n\nWinston nodded understandingly and asked him if Terry, who was also present during the murder event, was around the vineyard at this time, to which Jose confirmed.\n\nAfter reassuring Jose, he'd look into the matter, Winston began walking towards his car. Just as he was leaving, the obnoxious screech of the faulty bulldozer marked the end of an early lunch break.\n\nWinston sipped his black coffee as he stared out of his aging police cruiser, eyeing the sprawling vineyard and thinking about Terry. Reports had come in of a heated exchange between Terry and Bella. A scenario that happened right after Terry caught Bella red-handed with a bottle of rare, expensive wine she hadn't paid for. An intern. Bella, whose name had been brought up more and more frequently in recent times due to her increasing thieving activities. \n\nShe hadn't left the vineyard that day. Bella, who was spotted near the shed just minutes before Terry's body was found there. It was adding up, and something heavy was pressing on Winston's gut. He quietly exited his cruiser and walked over to Bella, who was diligently maintaining the vineyard's tools after work. \n\n\"Ma'am,\" Winston began. His greeting was met with a simple nod from Bella.\n\n\"Bella, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" she replied.\n\n\"You were here all day?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Everyone around here can tell you that,\" she murmured. \n\nAn old red-and-green painted shed stood in the distance. He knew Bella had the privilege of going in and out without supervision. A luxury that troubled him, especially given her recent knack for stealing. \n\n\"Busy day today?\" Winston asked, glancing at Bella's hands.\n\n\"Always. I keep these tools as clean and sharp as possible,\" she replied, holding up a newly sharpened pruner. Her delicate hands belied the hardened steel of the instruments. \n\nWinston nodded, casting his gaze to one of the metal figurines intricately sculpted by Bella herself. \n\n\"You do this?\" he asked, pointing. \n\nBella nodded, a small smile flashing across her face. She seemed to relish the precision, the skill required, and the metalwork. It was clear she was good at this. His eyes narrowed slightly as he put the figurine back down.\n\nHer penchant for stealing wasn't just limited to the tools or anything she could lay her hands on. It was whispered around the vineyard that Bella had a keen taste for the wine here. Especially the rare and pricey varieties, which had been disappearing more frequently than before. Terry wasn't a fan though, especially after catching her in the act. Winston had found himself unusually bothered by what was open knowledge. Particularly, Terry's threat to report Bella to management if it continued.\n\nOn his way back to his cruiser, Winston remembered a particularly vivid memory from his briefing; Terry shouting at Bella right in front of the shed. The memory sent a chill running down his spine. He wore a stoic face in front of her, nodded in acknowledgment, and walked away. His gut was telling him that she had more to say, and he planned to stick around.

I can't afford to lose it.\"\n\nWinston nodded understandingly and asked him if Terry, who was also present during the murder event, was around the vineyard at this time, to which Jose confirmed.\n\nAfter reassuring Jose, he'd look into the matter, Winston began walking towards his car. Just as he was leaving, the obnoxious screech of the faulty bulldozer marked the end of an early lunch break.\n\nWinston sipped his black coffee as he stared out of his aging police cruiser, eyeing the sprawling vineyard and thinking about Terry. Reports had come in of a heated exchange between Terry and Bella. A scenario that happened right after Terry caught Bella red-handed with a bottle of rare, expensive wine she hadn't paid for. An intern. Bella, whose name had been brought up more and more frequently in recent times due to her increasing thieving activities. \n\nShe hadn't left the vineyard that day. Bella, who was spotted near the shed just minutes before Terry's body was found there. It was adding up, and something heavy was pressing on Winston's gut. He quietly exited his cruiser and walked over to Bella, who was diligently maintaining the vineyard's tools after work. \n\n\"Ma'am,\" Winston began. His greeting was met with a simple nod from Bella.\n\n\"Bella, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" she replied.\n\n\"You were here all day?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Everyone around here can tell you that,\" she murmured. \n\nAn old red-and-green painted shed stood in the distance. He knew Bella had the privilege of going in and out without supervision. A luxury that troubled him, especially given her recent knack for stealing. \n\n\"Busy day today?\" Winston asked, glancing at Bella's hands.\n\n\"Always. I keep these tools as clean and sharp as possible,\" she replied, holding up a newly sharpened pruner. Her delicate hands belied the hardened steel of the instruments. \n\nWinston nodded, casting his gaze to one of the metal figurines intricately sculpted by Bella herself. \n\n\"You do this?\" he asked, pointing. \n\nBella nodded, a small smile flashing across her face. She seemed to relish the precision, the skill required, and the metalwork. It was clear she was good at this. His eyes narrowed slightly as he put the figurine back down.\n\nHer penchant for stealing wasn't just limited to the tools or anything she could lay her hands on. It was whispered around the vineyard that Bella had a keen taste for the wine here. Especially the rare and pricey varieties, which had been disappearing more frequently than before. Terry wasn't a fan though, especially after catching her in the act. Winston had found himself unusually bothered by what was open knowledge. Particularly, Terry's threat to report Bella to management if it continued.\n\nOn his way back to his cruiser, Winston remembered a particularly vivid memory from his briefing; Terry shouting at Bella right in front of the shed. The memory sent a chill running down his spine. He wore a stoic face in front of her, nodded in acknowledgment, and walked away. His gut was telling him that she had more to say, and he planned to stick around. Somewhat of a sixth sense, he attributed it to his years on the force.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Bella\nB.

Eyeing the images, it became immediately apparent among the ropes, carabiners, and pitons that Wade always had one particular piece of gear with him - an axe. Along with the axe, a curious detail drew his attention - a blue bead bracelet that Wade wore on every climb.\n\nAs Winston was engrossed in his photographic search, his assistant entered the room, her eyes teary. \"Detective, I confronted Wade about my bracelet, the one he keeps wearing,\" she said, noticeably upset. \"He brushed me off, claiming that it became a necessary memento from an infamous climbing adventure with him.\" \n\nScratchy phone recorded deductions hung in the air as a woman's voice filled the room, \"Hugo was said to have checked into the campground... the same day as Wade.\"\n\nWinston tapped the ash from his cigarette into an old coffee mug and decided it was time to have a little chat with Mr. Wade. \n\nPulling up to the nearby climbing spot, which was also a well-known campground, he found Wade wiping the sweat off his brow as he examined a climbing route, axe handle sticking out from his backpack.

Wade had worn the same bracelet during many of his climbs since their unfortunate expedition, even calling it his “lucky charm.” So much so, that it garnered attention on social media.\n\n\"My understanding is you venture here quite often for your climbing escapades,\" Winston inquired.\n\n\"That's right,\" Wade answered casually, seemingly unaware of the implications of Winston’s words.\n\n\"And these climbs you embark on... they always need an axe, I presume?\" Winston pointed at the tool that held such relevance.\n\n“Depends on the route, detective.

One step in the investigation was over, but many were still left to climb.\n\nWinston was sitting alone in his office, pouring over the sparse details he had on Hugo's murder. The crime scene, a picturesque campground, had been a haven for families just hours before. Winston rubbed his temples, knowing full well that these types of cases took delicate maneuvering, careful data collection. His lead suspect, a man named Salvador, was Hugo's driving instructor. This connection alone might not mean much, but it was a start. \n\nWinston took a deep breath, called up the local police and made an appointment to subtly interview Salvador. \n\nWinston found him at the driving school, hands deftly managing a hairpin turn while teaching a student. After the driving lesson ended, Winston introduced himself. \n\n\"Salvador?\" \n\n\"Yeah, that's me,\" he replied, wiping sweat from his brow.\n\nWinston motioned to a nearby bench. \"Do you mind if we chat for a few moments?\"\n\nSalvador glanced at his watch. \"Sure, I've got a few minutes.\"\n\nThey sat. \n\n\"Nice day out, isn't it?\" Canvasing the area, Winston's eyes landed on a small poster. The image was of a verdant campground, similar to the one where Hugo was killed. \"You like camping, Salvador?\"\n\nSalvador, caught off guard, blinked. \"Yes, I do. I go regularly, whenever I can... even to that campground over there\". \n\nThey chatted about the great outdoors, the joy of being connected with nature, and the complexities of their camping hobbies. Salvador didn’t seem aware that Winston’s questions were leading to anything in particular.\n\nAfter a few minutes of casual conversation, Winston stood up from the bench. \"Thanks for talking with me, Salvador. Nice day, isn't it?\" \n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" Salvador replied, stretching his arms. He watched Winston drove away curiously, before shaking his head and walking back to his car.\n\nWinston's next stop was Salvador's house; he observed from a safe distance as Salvador fiddled with something in his garage. Later, when Salvador had retreated into his house, Winston took a closer look under the cover of darkness. He could see an array of axes, various sizes and shapes, displayed proudly on a wall. He saw newly chopped wood stacked neatly in the corner of his backyard, evidence of Salvador’s recent chopping endeavours.\n\nWinston shared his observations with the local police but stepped back after providing his input.

It was clear that Salvador knew how to handle an axe, and there was one found at his place that matched the murder weapon.\n\nWinston knew convictions weren't made on this sort of circumstantial evidence, but there were threads that linked Salvador to the crime scene.

After the driving lesson ended, Winston introduced himself. \n\n\"Salvador?\" \n\n\"Yeah, that's me,\" he replied, wiping sweat from his brow.\n\nWinston motioned to a nearby bench. \"Do you mind if we chat for a few moments?\"\n\nSalvador glanced at his watch. \"Sure, I've got a few minutes.\"\n\nThey sat. \n\n\"Nice day out, isn't it?\" Canvasing the area, Winston's eyes landed on a small poster. The image was of a verdant campground, similar to the one where Hugo was killed. \"You like camping, Salvador?\"\n\nSalvador, caught off guard, blinked. \"Yes, I do. I go regularly, whenever I can... even to that campground over there\". \n\nThey chatted about the great outdoors, the joy of being connected with nature, and the complexities of their camping hobbies. Salvador didn’t seem aware that Winston’s questions were leading to anything in particular.\n\nAfter a few minutes of casual conversation, Winston stood up from the bench. \"Thanks for talking with me, Salvador. Nice day, isn't it?\" \n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" Salvador replied, stretching his arms. He watched Winston drove away curiously, before shaking his head and walking back to his car.\n\nWinston's next stop was Salvador's house; he observed from a safe distance as Salvador fiddled with something in his garage. Later, when Salvador had retreated into his house, Winston took a closer look under the cover of darkness. He could see an array of axes, various sizes and shapes, displayed proudly on a wall. He saw newly chopped wood stacked neatly in the corner of his backyard, evidence of Salvador’s recent chopping endeavours.\n\nWinston shared his observations with the local police but stepped back after providing his input.

He didn’t provide any strong alibi for where he was that night. He admitted that he was in the vicinity, at that campground where he regularly camped, but no one witnessed him there. It was clear that Salvador knew how to handle an axe, and there was one found at his place that matched the murder weapon.\n\nWinston knew convictions weren't made on this sort of circumstantial evidence, but there were threads that linked Salvador to the crime scene.

Eyeing the images, it became immediately apparent among the ropes, carabiners, and pitons that Wade always had one particular piece of gear with him - an axe. Along with the axe, a curious detail drew his attention - a blue bead bracelet that Wade wore on every climb.\n\nAs Winston was engrossed in his photographic search, his assistant entered the room, her eyes teary. \"Detective, I confronted Wade about my bracelet, the one he keeps wearing,\" she said, noticeably upset. \"He brushed me off, claiming that it became a necessary memento from an infamous climbing adventure with him.\" \n\nScratchy phone recorded deductions hung in the air as a woman's voice filled the room, \"Hugo was said to have checked into the campground... the same day as Wade.\"\n\nWinston tapped the ash from his cigarette into an old coffee mug and decided it was time to have a little chat with Mr. Wade. \n\nPulling up to the nearby climbing spot, which was also a well-known campground, he found Wade wiping the sweat off his brow as he examined a climbing route, axe handle sticking out from his backpack. The seasoned detective noted that they were at the plot adjacent to where Hugo had camped.\n\nWade looked up, seeing Winston step out of his car. \"Hey, detective... what brings you out here?\"\n\nWinston crossed his arms, gaze lingering on the axe handle. \"Thought it was time we had a chat.\"\n\nWade chuckled, adjusting the strap of the blue bead bracelet that was hanging loosely on his wrist, \"Alright then, shoot.\"\n\nWinston observed the bracelet, recognizing it from the pictures. Wade had worn the same bracelet during many of his climbs since their unfortunate expedition, even calling it his “lucky charm.” So much so, that it garnered attention on social media.\n\n\"My understanding is you venture here quite often for your climbing escapades,\" Winston inquired.\n\n\"That's right,\" Wade answered casually, seemingly unaware of the implications of Winston’s words.\n\n\"And these climbs you embark on... they always need an axe, I presume?\" Winston pointed at the tool that held such relevance.\n\n“Depends on the route, detective. Good to have it with me though,” Wade replied, clearly more interested in his climbing equipment than the conversation.\n\nNoting the piece of jewelry, Winston decided the conversation had run its course. \"You were camping here the same day as Hugo, weren’t you?\"\n\n“Yeah,” Wade replied, losing his grin, “I believe so. We were actually just a few plots apart. Didn’t know him well though.”\n\n“Hmm, alright…” Winston muttered, tipping his hat in goodbye as he got back into his car. His assistant’s bracelet glinted in the sunlight as Wade prepared for his climb. One step in the investigation was over, but many were still left to climb.\n\nWinston was sitting alone in his office, pouring over the sparse details he had on Hugo's murder. The crime scene, a picturesque campground, had been a haven for families just hours before. Winston rubbed his temples, knowing full well that these types of cases took delicate maneuvering, careful data collection. His lead suspect, a man named Salvador, was Hugo's driving instructor.

Daisy wasn't your typical suspect - she was a singer who always had a passion for her art form, a passion that stood in sharp contrast with her family's dismissive attitude.\n\n“I'm just trying to get ahead in life, you know?\" she told Winston as they sat in a small cafe near one of her repeat performance venues - an old building that was frequently harshly criticised for its lack of cleanliness. \"They never cared about my music… always thought it was just a phase. I couldn't stand their lack of support.”\n\nGetting rid of her family members from her contacts was, as she put it, a \"cleansing experience\". It was all very telling of Daisy's meticulous nature - she extended the same cleanliness philosophy to everything in her personal life, hygiene being her top priority; it gave a stark contrast to the venues in which she performed.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, she casually added, \"Sometimes my sarcasm gets the best of me. I can't tell you how many family dinners I've ruined with it. My sarcasm stings so hard, it often leaves them in tears.\"\n\nWinston thought about Rose, who often parked her car in the same vicinity. \"You were scheduled to perform at a place near that parking lot that day… right?\" he asked. Daisy affirmed the fact and mentioned having seen Rose's car, acknowledging that she and Rose were the last two people in the vehicle after her show that night.\n\nAs part of her performances, Daisy often integrated different kinds of acid into her routines - the same kind, as it turned out, that had been used to murder Rose. A cold chill ran down Winston’s spine as he mentally cross-checked the evidence list.\n\n“Acid isn’t a typical instrument for a singer, Daisy...\" Winston quizzed, trying to keep the conversation casual. Daisy just shrugged, \"Got to create a spectacle, right? Attract an audience?”\n\nDaisy had always been adamant about not attending any family gatherings - a fact that did not change even after Rose’s death. But she claimed to hold no ill-will towards Rose. As Winston got up from the table to leave, he turned one final time to look at Daisy who was now alone and engrossed in her phone. A suspect or not, one thing was certain, the story was far from over.\n\nWinston reeked of grease and sweat as he strolled into the electronics store, blinking against the twisted glare of neon and the sharp gleam of fluorescent lights. Dexter, a wiry man in neatly pressed slacks and a polo, paused in checking and restocking the freshly stocked batteries to greet him.\n\n\"You look lost, sir,\" he called, a spark in his eyes belying the monotony in his voice.\n\n\"Actually, I have a few questions for you, if that's not too much trouble,\" Winston started, flipping open his notepad to gather his thoughts.\n\nA flicker of unease crossed Dexter’s face, but he masked it quickly, \"Sure, always happy to help.\"\n\nWinston dove straight in, \"Know a woman by the name of Rose?\"\n\nDexter's face tightened imperceptibly. \"Rose, yeah. I know of her. She left her car here to get cleaned the other day. She told me that she had found an embarrassing picture of me somewhere.\"\n\n\"So, you work on cars too?\"\n\n\"I... not exactly. I was on duty when she came by. We don't usually offer those services, but I took care of it,\" he replied, his gaze straying to the poster advertising their recently received new stock of batteries.\n\n\"What type of cleaning, exactly?\" Winston asked, silently noting another stain on the pristine floors.\n\n\"Uh... just vacuuming, mostly. People leave all kinds of things in their cars,\" he concluded, avoiding Winston's steely gaze. \"I found the embarrassing photo of myself in there, the one she had claimed to have found earlier.\"\n\n\"Must have seen a lot of interesting things.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you could say that.\" Dexter's voice wavered, a hint of bitterness creeping in.\n\n\"Were you alone while cleaning the car?\"\n\n\"Yes.

The laughter, Rose's cruel laughter at Dexter during that town gathering, rang in his memory. \n\nDexter spoke after a pause, \"I...didn't know she still had that.\"\n\n\"One more question,\" Winston started, leaving the silence to hang as Dexter looked about to collapse. \"Your education...you studied Chemistry?

Alone in the desert, with the grim encore of death, Philip’s fate felt oddly disconnected from the realities of the bustling metropolis.\n\nWinston pondered over the crucial facts concerning the deceased Philip, particularly those relating to a certain dockworker, Jim. He was reminded of the small piece of evidence that came along with a ledger found in Philip's frozen hands. The ledger chronicled complex illegal smuggling operations. Notably among those was crucial information that it detailed illegal smuggling operations that Jim was involved with at the docks, making the ledger belonging to Jim even more incriminating.\n\nIt was known that Jim often sought solitude in the quiet, sweeping desert that Philip was found. In fact, the day of Philip's death, it was known that Jim had spent a significant amount of time there in the desert, with Philip.\n\nWinston resolved to head to the docks as his initial step. He knew Jim worked there, and was also an active participant in some form of martial arts training. The docks, apart from being a bustling hub of commerce, also had a lesser-known martial arts center. Additionally, Jim was known to be struggling under a heavy amount of debt, a large part of which he owed to Philip.\n\nUpon arriving at the docks, Winston observed the various trading activities. He noticed all kinds of commodities, including weapons like nunchaku being moved around. He couldn't help but wonder if some of the strains from Jim's debt might be channelled into these unlawful acts, particularly the illicit smuggling operations that Jim was deeply entrenched with at the docks.\n\n“Hey, Jim! your presence is needed!\" announced Winston, drawing the attention of a towering, muscular figure.\n\n“Wow, Winston, you seem all business today,\" replied Jim, affably, turning to face his visitor.\n\n“You weren’t working today?” queried Winston, scrutinizing Jim's reaction. Giving a carefree shrug, Jim responded, \"Yes, occasionally we get the day off, like today.\"\n\nJim's actions had a disciplined, well-practiced grace, something Winston noted was consistent with someone undergoing martial arts training. When Winston asked about his training, Jim confirmed it with a simple nod.\n\n“So, what about the money you owed Philip?” Winston asked, causing a silence to fall over them, broken only by the sounds of crashing waves. The burden of the enormous debt to Philip weighed heavily on Jim, evidenced by his discomfort.\n\n“Philip... He came across some... documents,” Jim confessed, his gaze focused elsewhere, “He planned to use them against me. Though, it's irrelevant now.\"\n\nDuring their conversation, Winston learned Jim not only lazed around the desert, but on the day of Philip's death, he had spent a significant portion of the day there in the desert with Philip. Moreover, that happened to be a day when Jim had no work obligations elsewhere.\n\nSoon, Winston found himself alone, watching as Jim left. After a moment’s contemplation, he figured his next action would be to visit the desert where Philip’s body was found.\n\nWinston was walking towards the park with his hands in his pockets, dust from the trail whirling up around him as he went. His furrowed brows gave way to the seriousness he was to face discussing Philip's murder with his grandfather, Woodrow.\n\nWoodrow was a frail looking old man. However, his frailty was physically deceptive. He was still as spry as a young deer when it came to his martial arts routine, he had been doing it every single day, religiously, after he had retired from forty long years of teaching martial arts. He was even sweating from his usual morning exercises when he walked up for their meeting.\n\n\"Winston, am I right?\" Woodrow asked, nervously shifting his feet and clearing his throat constantly. To an observing party, it might almost look like nervous ticks. \n\nWinston nodded, not missing the unusual behavior, before he cleared his throat and asked, \"You've lived in this small town all your life, Woodrow?\" which the elderly man confirmed, stating that he had strong roots within his family and loved everyone fiercely. \n\nHe held on to a coffee cup, which steamed slightly in the morning chill. He had been discussing the local park regulations with the passing-by officials while sipping slowly from the cup.\n\nInterrupting their conversation was an unexpected arrival from a police officer, which resulted in Woodrow spilling his coffee on the cold concrete in surprise. \n\nAfter quick introductions and some reluctant banter, they walked towards Woodrow's weather-beaten house just outside the park. Inside, Winston couldn't help but get drawn towards the shelves, which displayed an array of martial arts-related memorabilia, many of which were used by Woodrow himself during his teaching years. His eyes fell on a pair of nunchaku kept securely within a glass case.\n\n\"Treasures from better times,\" Woodrow murmured looking at his collection.\n\nThe conversation soon shifted towards Philip. Philip, the man who had shown no remorse publicly humiliating Woodrow. Philip was a tough bone to crack, his abusive nature had managed to alienate not only Woodrow, but almost every member of their family.\n\n\"Philip was a tough man to deal with.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the glitzy, high-stakes world of casinos, Jamal meets a deadly end by frog poison, leaving Detective Winston to weave through a web of deceit with two prime suspects - Kimberly and Lillian.\n\nWinston took a moment to steady his thoughts as he pushed through the bustling casino crowd and headed towards the high stakes tables, where the Kurten family, a notable name in the city that Kimberly Kurten was always so intensely proud of, often gathered.\n\nIn his possession, he had copies of the casino’s surveillance footage, which clearly showed Kimberly not leaving the casino until after the events of the tragic night had unraveled. It was indeed an unusual evening, where he had gained knowledge that Jamal was about to reveal his secret gambling problem, a scandal that could have undoubtedly ruined the reputation of the Kurten family, before his tragic death ended those plans untimely.\n\nWinston found Kimberly, Jamal's grandmother, sitting sullenly with a spent slot machine, her eyes tired and glassy. She was always a lady of resolve, and her attire tonight attested her character. The familiar cigarette smoke-infused air around her gave gravity to the situation.\n\n\"We heard you've been interested in studying unique frog species,\" Winston started tentatively, referencing her recent purchase of a rare and highly poisonous frog, without failing to mention about the documents found in her home, which not only discussed extracting venom from the said species but also comprehensively detailed physical effects of the frog's lethal doses,\n\n\"Yes,\" Kimberly admitted. \"It's quite a fascinating hobby that I've picked up.\"\n\n\"Do you know the frog you own can be highly lethal?\" Winston probed, watching her reaction closely.\n\n\"Well, I am aware. In fact, I've read all about it, and that formed a substantial part of my research, especially investigating the effects of its venom,\" said Kimberly, revealing her ongoing project for the first time.\n\nNodding, Winston changed the subject. \"You were with Jamal here at the casino, the night he tragically died, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said softly, her voice barely audible over the chorus of slot machines and croupier calls. \"We both came here together.\"\n\n\"On the surveillance footage, it appears you brought Jamal his favorite drink that night. Barely a few moments after he had it, he collapsed.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's correct, Detective Winston,\" Kimberly confirmed, her gaze fixed somewhere distant, \"He wasn't feeling well all evening. I've always been worried about his reckless gambling, and the impact it would have on our standing in society, not to mention the ruin it would have brought upon us if he had his way.\"\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, Winston rose to excuse himself, leaving Kimberly dwelling in the harsh neon lights, weighed down by a grandmother's sorrow. Despite the clamoring commotion around him, Winston found an eerie silence; a tragic tale of love, concern, and reputation had unraveled that night.\n\nSitting in his criminally underlit office, Detective Winston pored over the case files for Jamal's murder. His brow furrowed at the cause of death - a lethal frog poison. The corners of his mouth twitched with a hint of moroseness and intrigue, as he thought of the exotic demise of a man so influential and with no known heirs or successors - except his goddaughter Lillian.\n\nWinston decided to pay Lillian, the goddaughter of the deceased, a visit. He remembered the name Lillian, an up-and-coming biologist specializing in amphibians, and now the apparent successor to Jamal's influential position — a coincidence too striking to ignore.\n\nOn arriving at Lillian's residence, he knocked and was greeted by Lillian's younger brother, who he had noticed earlier mentioned a strict 9 p.m. curfew enforced by their parents — a prospect seeming unusual considering Lillian's mature age.\n\n\"Detective Winston, how can I help you?\" Lillian's voice was calm. Winston, with practiced ease, began to ask the routine questions.\n\n\"I understand from your colleagues at the research facility that you have spent years studying the toxins of various rare frog species. That's remarkable.\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe amphibians are hugely underestimated in their biological significance,\" Lillian responded, an earnest enthusiasm glowing in her eyes.\n\nHer comment whisked Winston's thoughts back to the exotic murder weapon. \"Are there any of such poisonous species that you happen to own?\"\n\nA slight hitch in Lillian's demeanor suggested hesitation. \"Yes, I do own a rare species of frog known to produce lethal toxins.\"\n\nLeaning back and taking note of her demeanor, Winston changed the topic slightly. \"Did you know about the late-night visits Jamal used to pay to the casino?\"\n\n\"No, but I knew of his influence and power in the community,\" Lillian replied, her eyes distant as she pondered over memories of her late godfather. She further added, \"Jamal didn't have any other known successors and being his goddaughter, I've always desired to be as respected and influential as he was, and to even take his position one day.\"\n\nAs Winston prepared to leave, the local store owner from across the street approached him, offering a piece of information he hadn't considered.\n\n\"Saw Lillian over there popping out late for snacks,\" he mumbled; a detail that contradicted the household rule of strict curfew mentioned by Lillian's brother. It was backed up by another neighbor, who mentioned seeing Lillian sneaking out after dark on numerous occasions.\n\nIt appeared there was more to this goddaughter, this aspiring biologist, than met the eye.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the glitzy, high-stakes world of casinos, Jamal meets a deadly end by frog poison, leaving Detective Winston to weave through a web of deceit with two prime suspects - Kimberly and Lillian.\n\nWinston took a moment to steady his thoughts as he pushed through the bustling casino crowd and headed towards the high stakes tables, where the Kurten family, a notable name in the city that Kimberly Kurten was always so intensely proud of, often gathered.\n\nIn his possession, he had copies of the casino’s surveillance footage, which clearly showed Kimberly not leaving the casino until after the events of the tragic night had unraveled. It was indeed an unusual evening, where he had gained knowledge that Jamal was about to reveal his secret gambling problem, a scandal that could have undoubtedly ruined the reputation of the Kurten family, before his tragic death ended those plans untimely.\n\nWinston found Kimberly, Jamal's grandmother, sitting sullenly with a spent slot machine, her eyes tired and glassy. She was always a lady of resolve, and her attire tonight attested her character. The familiar cigarette smoke-infused air around her gave gravity to the situation.\n\n\"We heard you've been interested in studying unique frog species,\" Winston started tentatively, referencing her recent purchase of a rare and highly poisonous frog, without failing to mention about the documents found in her home, which not only discussed extracting venom from the said species but also comprehensively detailed physical effects of the frog's lethal doses,\n\n\"Yes,\" Kimberly admitted. \"It's quite a fascinating hobby that I've picked up.\"\n\n\"Do you know the frog you own can be highly lethal?\" Winston probed, watching her reaction closely.\n\n\"Well, I am aware. In fact, I've read all about it, and that formed a substantial part of my research, especially investigating the effects of its venom,\" said Kimberly, revealing her ongoing project for the first time.\n\nNodding, Winston changed the subject. \"You were with Jamal here at the casino, the night he tragically died, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said softly, her voice barely audible over the chorus of slot machines and croupier calls. \"We both came here together.\"\n\n\"On the surveillance footage, it appears you brought Jamal his favorite drink that night. Barely a few moments after he had it, he collapsed.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's correct, Detective Winston,\" Kimberly confirmed, her gaze fixed somewhere distant, \"He wasn't feeling well all evening. I've always been worried about his reckless gambling, and the impact it would have on our standing in society, not to mention the ruin it would have brought upon us if he had his way.\"\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, Winston rose to excuse himself, leaving Kimberly dwelling in the harsh neon lights, weighed down by a grandmother's sorrow. Despite the clamoring commotion around him, Winston found an eerie silence; a tragic tale of love, concern, and reputation had unraveled that night.\n\nSitting in his criminally underlit office, Detective Winston pored over the case files for Jamal's murder. His brow furrowed at the cause of death - a lethal frog poison. The corners of his mouth twitched with a hint of moroseness and intrigue, as he thought of the exotic demise of a man so influential and with no known heirs or successors - except his goddaughter Lillian.\n\nWinston decided to pay Lillian, the goddaughter of the deceased, a visit.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the eerie silence of a moonlit swamp, Leroy's life was gruesomely ended by a sai, setting the stage for Detective Winston's most perplexing murder investigation yet, with suspects Clayton and Madelyn cloaked in mystery.\n\nIt was a sweltering summer afternoon when Detective Winston strolled into the local martial arts store. The store owner welcomed Winston with a smile, \"Can I help you? Looking to step out of that detective uniform and into a martial arts gi?\"\n\n\"No,\" Winston chuckled, \"Here on business. Trying to find some information about a pair of sai that was purchased from here.\" \n\nThe owner furrowed his brow, \"Well, many people come in here to buy sai's. Hard to remember them all.\"\n\n\"How about a tall woman, brunette, goes by the name Madelyn?\" Winston inquired.\n\n\"Madelyn... oh, she's a personal trainer focused on martial arts. She bought a pair of sai's from me a while ago. Saw her practicing with it at the local gym once,\" The owner shared more,\" I heard her talking about trusting a few close friends who ended up betraying her, which was tough on her.\"\n\nWinston decided it was time to pay Madelyn a visit. \n\nUpon arrival at the gym, Winston spotted Madelyn in the middle of a training session. As he approached, he overheard Madelyn and Leroy, one of her clients with whom she has regular conversations, talking. \"Didn't you used to train with Leroy out at the swamp?\" her partner asked, catching his breath in-between sets. \n\n\"Yeah, I did. We frequented the swamp for some outdoor training. But he told me he was thinking about changing trainers. Last I saw him, he mentioned heading out to the swamp and planned to meet with my rival for confidential conversations,\" Madelyn replied, not seeming disturbed by the topic.\n\nJust then a phone rang. Leroy smiled apologetically at Madelyn whose eyes slightly doubt those smiles. He excused himself and moved to a corner of the gym but still in sight of Madelyn. Leroy talked over the phone with a certain intensity. Winston overheard the conversation and realized that it was Madelyn's rival on the other end.\n\nJust as Winston approached Madelyn, she finished demonstrating an exemplary sai technique to her current client. The conversation he'd overheard and Madelyn's evidently skillful handling of the sai intrigued him. \n\nHe introduced himself and asked for a few minutes of her time. She obliged, accompanying him to a quieter corner of the gym. \"You've been training Leroy for the past few months, correct?\"\n\nMadelyn's eyes flickered a hint of surprise, \"Yes, I have. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"No special reason. Just trying to figure out a few things,\" Winston replied calmly. He was mindful not to let any suspicions arise. He noted that Madelyn seemed to be aware of Leroy's conversation with her rival and that she was around the vicinity that day. He vaguely recalled something about Leroy planning to ditch Madelyn as his trainer.\n\nWinston left the gym with a budding curiosity, wondering about Madelyn's past friendships and betrayals. He had heard through the grapevine and now firsthand from the store owner about Madelyn being betrayed in the past by close friends. Winston knew better than most, that old wounds sometimes pushed people over the edge. He made a quick mental note to follow up on this lead the next chance he got.\n\nWinston gazed at the murky waters of the swamp crime scene. The grim sight of Leroy's untimely demise probing him to dig deep. He knew none of this was circumstantial, and his insistence on finding what happened was building momentum. Beginning to question Clayton, Winston quickly turned to the night of the crime.\n\n\"Where were you when this happened, Clayton?\" Instead of answering directly, Clayton sidestepped the question with whereabouts deflections, \"The swamp is big, detective, could be anywhere...You know my work, survival training and all that.\" \n\nMoving to Clayton being a local swamp guide, he touted the detective with a bravado that didn't quite sit well. Winston had seen him many times before, on those survival tours he hosted, slogging around in the swamp like a kid in the rain. A man of many faces, all too familiar with this swamp.\n\n\"Always visiting this swamp alone, Clayton? Even on the day of the murder?\" Winston demanded, his coy glance cut through Clayton's unease. \"Just my daily routine… and solitude helps me cope,\" Clayton barely admitted, implying he spent the entire day of the murder alone.\n\nTaking his investigation to the local tavern, Winston mused over the conversations he'd had with the patrons. Clayton leaving the bar, alone, around the time of the crime was a constant motif he couldn't shake off. The ever resentful, Clayton, skulking into his car at night etched a picture hard to ignore.\n\nWhile unraveling the connection between Clayton and a known criminal, a top regular directed Winston to a corner of the bar, \"Detective, see there...Clayton with that damn felon, always hissing back and forth.\" Winston couldn’t decipher what they said, but the veil surrounding their hushed conversations disturbed him.\n\nMoreover, Clayton's complex love life added to the intrigues. The quick switch in ex-wife's love from Clayton to Leroy, followed by a swift marriage had wounded Clayton. His love for her was clear, and Leroy, well, he was a barrier to their possible reconciliation. A small-town rumor that his ex-wife was so taken with Leroy that she had exclaimed, \"I won't even think about patching things up with Clayton as long as Leroy is around!\" ensured Clayton had real reasons to begrudge Leroy. \n\nThe evening came to an end with Winston feeling no closer to a resolution. He exited the bar, his thoughts jumbled with images of a vengeful Clayton, an infatuated, criminal whispering, and the memory of a solitary figure in the murky swamp, evasive responses hanging in the air. His quest for justice uncompromising, as he slipped into the night, the puzzle still seemed incomplete.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Clayton\nB.

As he smoothed the slightly wrinkled photograph of the victim, he couldn't help but acknowledge the gravity of the murder that had taken place out in the desolate stretches of the desert.\n\n\"Heard you requested a flamethrower for your workshop,\" Winston started as he visited Paige, Renee's mentee, at her special effects shop. She let him in, even showing him around her tools which included a newly acquired flamethrower for realistic movie effects, which she was seen handling just a few days ago. Winston remembered walking by the open garage door and catching a glimpse of Paige playing with the flamethrower, her face what he could only describe as an excited child with a new toy.\n\n\"May I ask if you were the last person seen with Renee?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"Yes, detective, I was,\" Paige answered. \n\nSeeing no reason to evade the question, Paige mentioned how she repeatedly advised Renee to retire from her line of work. \"She was always stubborn and distant, especially with me,\" Paige shared, an indication of Renee trying to distance herself. \"She was in her sixties but she refused to slow down, causing me to feel constant frustration and would frequently make me lash out,\" Paige confided. \"It always upset me,\" she further admitted her thoughts, letting Winston understand the volatile mentor-protege relationship dynamics.\n\nWinston nodded, storing this important information about the dynamics between Paige and Renee. \"I have found out from the delivery company that a flamethrower was delivered to this workshop recently. Was it yours? The one you ordered?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's correct,\" Paige replied, her face unchanging. \"You see, I work in special effects. I deal with all sorts of contraptions, including flamethrowers. They're not as deadly as they seem, you know? Only in the wrong hands...\"\n\nIt seemed like Paige was positioning herself just within the edge of suspicion, but Winston kept his thoughts to himself, a stoic expression fixed on his face. He then asked about Paige's closeness with the desert, a quick detour from her workshop. \n\n\"Oh, it's easily accessible. I often take a walk to clear my head,\" she replied, \"And Renee knew about my frequent trips there, that's why it wasn't unusual for her when I told her I wanted to show her something in the desert.\"\n\nPaige's love for Renee was well known and she wasn't ready to hide it when asked. \"She was special to me, you know. But she never showed up to see what I planned. The next thing I know, she was dead.\"\n\nFeeling he had enough for the moment, Winston decided to end the conversation. Among the many things he had gathered, a fact that stuck to him was the requested flamethrower, seen in Paige's possession a few days ago, was also the murder weapon used in this case, delivered right at Paige's workshop.\n\nAs Winston was leaving, Paige's gaze followed him. She had a look of a woman caught in a tale of true obsession.\n\nWinston parked his car in front of the coffee shop. The afternoon was calm and dry, typical of a day in the desert.\n\n\"Marianne.\" He called to the barista working behind the counter.\n\n\"Yes sir, what can I get you?\" She looked up with a plastered service smile that Winston had seen more often than he'd like to admit.\n\n\"Coffee, black,\" he added.\n\nMarianne was usually a woman of few words. It was already known in the café that Marianne, although a people person during work hours, preferred solitude outside of work. She was somewhat enigmatic, leaving work as soon as her shift ended without any explanation about her after-work plans. It was a habit she diligently stuck to, against curious coworkers who often loiter around longer.\n\n\"Winston, aren't you?\" She handed over the coffee, her facial expression gave away nothing. She had a breed of indifference that he found puzzling.\n\n\"Yeah, you remember.\" He toasted his coffee cup, looking at the foam art on its surface.\n\nRumor has it that Marianne had been spotted frequenting a local pawn shop on her way from work. Curiously, after one of her visits, a flamethrower was found missing from the shop - the owner had confirmed it himself, ruffling through the shop inventory in disbelief. A particular stock draw from the shop should technically be tagged a coincidence and yet, here he was.\n\n\"So, how'd you end up here?\" Winston decided to put out some line, in search of a bite.\n\n\"Needed a job, this did me good,\" she stated curtly, keeping it decidedly professional.\n\n\"I hear you gotta get fire safety certification to keep the espresso machines running and avoid mishaps. That true?\" He ventured further.\n\n\"Yeah, mandatory stuff.\" She added, the impenetrable exterior still intact.\n\n\"That's neat, handy skills I reckon.\" He sipped his coffee, testing the waters.\n\nThat's when he remembered the rumors – Marianne had been arrested for a theft charge. Worse yet, she was found guilty and now, a court date next week awaiting sentencing. It all seemed to tie back to an unfortunate event in the desert involving an individual named Renee, who had testified against Marianne in court. Not just a common run-in-the-mill victim, but linked to Marianne with a web of unknown connections.\n\n\"What time do you get off work?\" He asked, catching her off guard.\n\n\"I...like to go straight home.\" She fumbled her words. The confession about her arrest seemed to take the wind out of her sails.\n\nAfter a small chat about the dry weather, Winston mentioned he was headed to the pawn shop down the road, on the trail of the missing flamethrower, leaving a hint of a departing farewell. She visibly winced, although she recovered quickly, her unusually bright eyes watched him with a hint of alarm as he walked out.\n\nShe turned to the wall clock as soon as the shop door jingled shut - the end of her shift almost due.

She let him in, even showing him around her tools which included a newly acquired flamethrower for realistic movie effects, which she was seen handling just a few days ago. Winston remembered walking by the open garage door and catching a glimpse of Paige playing with the flamethrower, her face what he could only describe as an excited child with a new toy.\n\n\"May I ask if you were the last person seen with Renee?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"Yes, detective, I was,\" Paige answered. \n\nSeeing no reason to evade the question, Paige mentioned how she repeatedly advised Renee to retire from her line of work. \"She was always stubborn and distant, especially with me,\" Paige shared, an indication of Renee trying to distance herself. \"She was in her sixties but she refused to slow down, causing me to feel constant frustration and would frequently make me lash out,\" Paige confided. \"It always upset me,\" she further admitted her thoughts, letting Winston understand the volatile mentor-protege relationship dynamics.\n\nWinston nodded, storing this important information about the dynamics between Paige and Renee. \"I have found out from the delivery company that a flamethrower was delivered to this workshop recently. Was it yours? The one you ordered?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's correct,\" Paige replied, her face unchanging. \"You see, I work in special effects. I deal with all sorts of contraptions, including flamethrowers. They're not as deadly as they seem, you know? Only in the wrong hands...\"\n\nIt seemed like Paige was positioning herself just within the edge of suspicion, but Winston kept his thoughts to himself, a stoic expression fixed on his face. He then asked about Paige's closeness with the desert, a quick detour from her workshop. \n\n\"Oh, it's easily accessible. I often take a walk to clear my head,\" she replied, \"And Renee knew about my frequent trips there, that's why it wasn't unusual for her when I told her I wanted to show her something in the desert.\"\n\nPaige's love for Renee was well known and she wasn't ready to hide it when asked. \"She was special to me, you know. But she never showed up to see what I planned. The next thing I know, she was dead.\"\n\nFeeling he had enough for the moment, Winston decided to end the conversation. Among the many things he had gathered, a fact that stuck to him was the requested flamethrower, seen in Paige's possession a few days ago, was also the murder weapon used in this case, delivered right at Paige's workshop.\n\nAs Winston was leaving, Paige's gaze followed him.

It was already known in the café that Marianne, although a people person during work hours, preferred solitude outside of work. She was somewhat enigmatic, leaving work as soon as her shift ended without any explanation about her after-work plans. It was a habit she diligently stuck to, against curious coworkers who often loiter around longer.\n\n\"Winston, aren't you?\" She handed over the coffee, her facial expression gave away nothing. She had a breed of indifference that he found puzzling.\n\n\"Yeah, you remember.\" He toasted his coffee cup, looking at the foam art on its surface.\n\nRumor has it that Marianne had been spotted frequenting a local pawn shop on her way from work. Curiously, after one of her visits, a flamethrower was found missing from the shop - the owner had confirmed it himself, ruffling through the shop inventory in disbelief. A particular stock draw from the shop should technically be tagged a coincidence and yet, here he was.\n\n\"So, how'd you end up here?\" Winston decided to put out some line, in search of a bite.\n\n\"Needed a job, this did me good,\" she stated curtly, keeping it decidedly professional.\n\n\"I hear you gotta get fire safety certification to keep the espresso machines running and avoid mishaps. That true?\" He ventured further.\n\n\"Yeah, mandatory stuff.\" She added, the impenetrable exterior still intact.\n\n\"That's neat, handy skills I reckon.\" He sipped his coffee, testing the waters.\n\nThat's when he remembered the rumors – Marianne had been arrested for a theft charge. Worse yet, she was found guilty and now, a court date next week awaiting sentencing. It all seemed to tie back to an unfortunate event in the desert involving an individual named Renee, who had testified against Marianne in court. Not just a common run-in-the-mill victim, but linked to Marianne with a web of unknown connections.\n\n\"What time do you get off work?\" He asked, catching her off guard.\n\n\"I...like to go straight home.\" She fumbled her words. The confession about her arrest seemed to take the wind out of her sails.\n\nAfter a small chat about the dry weather, Winston mentioned he was headed to the pawn shop down the road, on the trail of the missing flamethrower, leaving a hint of a departing farewell.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nWhen fitness enthusiast Uma is ominously murdered with a vial of acid at her local gym, it's up to seasoned Detective Winston to unravel the mystery between the two prime suspects, Irving and Addison.\n\nDetective Winston was indoors on another stifling California afternoon. His attention was fixed on the Irving case, a case that kept him on his toes for several days now. A screenwriter suspected in the murder of a fellow gym goer. He couldn’t help but feel the increasing pressure of the time crunch.\n\nIrving was not an ordinary man. Winston had discovered from the interviews and police records that the guy particularly had some weird habits. Irving, it seemed, was battling insomnia and was unable to sleep in his own home at night. During these restless nights, he would busy himself with his notebooks. Often, he was seen at the fitness center, sketching intriguing symbols into his notebook, which he always carried along with his pencil. He would leave home with these immediately after sunset.\n\nOne specific detail that struck the detective was Irving's fascination with themes and symbols of the past, particularly those formed by ancient gravestones. These ancient symbols were found in notations and sketches strewn across his notebooks. It was curious to Winston how an old world art found a home in the hands of a modern screenwriter.\n\nHis insomniac late-night habits weren't the only thing that raised suspicions, though. Irving also was a member at the same fitness center Uma frequented, spotted regularly training late into the night. The very same fitness center that was the scene of the crime. The records substantiated his presence late on the night of the murder. Like the deceased Uma, he seemed to utilized the solitude that the near-empty gym provided, allowing him ample time alone.\n\nThe lines on Winston's forehead became more pronounced as he read on. He found a strange connection between both Uma's and Irving's lives. Not only did they work out at the same gym, but they also shared a professional conflict. Reports indicated that Uma had discovered Irving's success was largely built on her own work which he'd plagiarized. Fearing public humiliation and the definite demise of his screenwriting career, Irving had a lot to lose. To make matters worse for Irving, Uma, the aggrieved, had threatened to expose his deceit to the public.\n\nThe tension of the case was truly weighing on Winston. He sighed, leaning back from his desk. Questions in his mind demanded answers that weren't there yet. So, he decided to continue with the investigation, waiting for the breakthrough that would add some clarity to the clouded picture. He had a late-night meeting with the prime suspect, Irving, in the pipeline. It was indeed time to probe further and extract some answers from the silence of the night.\n\nDetective Winston admired the modern glow of the fitness center that served as his next stop in the investigation. The thudding of footfalls on running machines, the humming of weight machines, and the faint scent of sweat and disinfectant whispered of a place that had teetered on the edge of life and death.\n\n\"Lookin' to join?\" came a voice from behind him. He languidly turned to find Addison, the local trainer.\n\n\"No. Detective Winston, on official police business,\" he presented his badge.\n\nThe sour taste of surprise was evident on Addison's face, \"We're an excellent gym with a friendly vibe; it's a shame. You don't say, a detective?\"\n\n\"I've checked the fitness center security cameras,\" Winston watched as Addison pressed his lips together, \"Noticed you were entering the gym shortly before time of Uma's death.\"\n\nAddison placed a hand on a weight machine, lowering his gaze to his feet. \"Uma? You mean my client, Uma? We were scheduled for a training session that day.\"\n\nWinston opened his notebook, scanning his notes, \"You have a background in chemistry, is that right?\"\n\nAddison looked up from his shoes, \"Yeah, I even teach it at the high school. Possess a chemistry degree and recently purchased a chemistry set for demonstration.\"\n\n\"Interesting. The set contains vials of acid, science class protocol?\" Winston asked, his brow furrowing.\n\n\"Absolutely, controlled experiments to teach risk and safety,\" Addison said, transported into the world of academia. The detective noticed a flicker in Addison’s expression as he continued to speak but brushed it off, it meant nothing yet.\n\nA few people from the gym had crowded around now. They watched as Winston asked, \"Can you recall Uma saying anything about the honesty of the staff or maybe about any missing equipment?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Addison began, rubbing his neck, \"Uma did once vouch for me, said I was honest and commendable, a good character, you know.\" He looked around the room and swallowed. \"And yes, she did mention once about missing equipment. Unfortunately, she also stumbled upon some CCTV footage of me taking some expensive equipment. I had intended to return it, it was a mistake. \"\n\nAs Winston watched the gym members disperse, he looked back at Addison. \"So, Uma caught you stealing from the fitness center. That must've been uncomfortable for you. It surfaced in the investigation that fitness equipment has been reported missing recently. Uma seemed to have discovered the theft.\"\n\nAddison suddenly seemed to find the floor tiles fascinating. \"Uma was a good woman,\" he said quietly. \"It's a shame what happened to her.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Winston replied, closing his notebook. \"Keep a clear schedule, Addison. We'll be in touch.\"\n\nAs Winston exited the gym he took one more glance at Addison through the large glass panes.

He found a strange connection between both Uma's and Irving's lives. Not only did they work out at the same gym, but they also shared a professional conflict. Reports indicated that Uma had discovered Irving's success was largely built on her own work which he'd plagiarized. Fearing public humiliation and the definite demise of his screenwriting career, Irving had a lot to lose. To make matters worse for Irving, Uma, the aggrieved, had threatened to expose his deceit to the public.\n\nThe tension of the case was truly weighing on Winston. He sighed, leaning back from his desk. Questions in his mind demanded answers that weren't there yet. So, he decided to continue with the investigation, waiting for the breakthrough that would add some clarity to the clouded picture. He had a late-night meeting with the prime suspect, Irving, in the pipeline. It was indeed time to probe further and extract some answers from the silence of the night.\n\nDetective Winston admired the modern glow of the fitness center that served as his next stop in the investigation. The thudding of footfalls on running machines, the humming of weight machines, and the faint scent of sweat and disinfectant whispered of a place that had teetered on the edge of life and death.\n\n\"Lookin' to join?\" came a voice from behind him. He languidly turned to find Addison, the local trainer.\n\n\"No. Detective Winston, on official police business,\" he presented his badge.\n\nThe sour taste of surprise was evident on Addison's face, \"We're an excellent gym with a friendly vibe; it's a shame. You don't say, a detective?\"\n\n\"I've checked the fitness center security cameras,\" Winston watched as Addison pressed his lips together, \"Noticed you were entering the gym shortly before time of Uma's death.\"\n\nAddison placed a hand on a weight machine, lowering his gaze to his feet. \"Uma? You mean my client, Uma? We were scheduled for a training session that day.\"\n\nWinston opened his notebook, scanning his notes, \"You have a background in chemistry, is that right?\"\n\nAddison looked up from his shoes, \"Yeah, I even teach it at the high school. Possess a chemistry degree and recently purchased a chemistry set for demonstration.\"\n\n\"Interesting. The set contains vials of acid, science class protocol?\" Winston asked, his brow furrowing.\n\n\"Absolutely, controlled experiments to teach risk and safety,\" Addison said, transported into the world of academia. The detective noticed a flicker in Addison’s expression as he continued to speak but brushed it off, it meant nothing yet.\n\nA few people from the gym had crowded around now. They watched as Winston asked, \"Can you recall Uma saying anything about the honesty of the staff or maybe about any missing equipment?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Addison began, rubbing his neck, \"Uma did once vouch for me, said I was honest and commendable, a good character, you know.\" He looked around the room and swallowed. \"And yes, she did mention once about missing equipment. Unfortunately, she also stumbled upon some CCTV footage of me taking some expensive equipment. I had intended to return it, it was a mistake. \"\n\nAs Winston watched the gym members disperse, he looked back at Addison. \"So, Uma caught you stealing from the fitness center. That must've been uncomfortable for you. It surfaced in the investigation that fitness equipment has been reported missing recently. Uma seemed to have discovered the theft.\"\n\nAddison suddenly seemed to find the floor tiles fascinating. \"Uma was a good woman,\" he said quietly. \"It's a shame what happened to her.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Winston replied, closing his notebook. \"Keep a clear schedule, Addison. We'll be in touch.\"\n\nAs Winston exited the gym he took one more glance at Addison through the large glass panes.

His attention was fixed on the Irving case, a case that kept him on his toes for several days now. A screenwriter suspected in the murder of a fellow gym goer. He couldn’t help but feel the increasing pressure of the time crunch.\n\nIrving was not an ordinary man. Winston had discovered from the interviews and police records that the guy particularly had some weird habits. Irving, it seemed, was battling insomnia and was unable to sleep in his own home at night. During these restless nights, he would busy himself with his notebooks. Often, he was seen at the fitness center, sketching intriguing symbols into his notebook, which he always carried along with his pencil.

Beneath the bubbles, the crime scene lay at the bottom of the ocean, a place that was supposed to be a sanctuary for divers like Julian. \n\nHis train of thought was interrupted by his partner who handed him a pile of interview transcripts and surveillance files to go through. He was about to dive into the world of their main suspect, Clara.\n\nComing from a workstation that was perpetually cluttered with stacks of serial killer novels, Clara no doubt had a keen interest in the subject matter. She was frequently engrossed in conversations about infamous serial killers, delving into their modus operandi with unsettling accuracy without any need for references. During her lunch breaks, she could always be found pouring over one of her many true crime books.\n\nClara, a skilled metal worker, had a specific niche in crafting a variety of unique crowbars, which had become her signature work. Her craftsmanship was distinct and always earned her respect amongst her peers. Going through a surveillance tape, he watched as Clara loaded her uniquely crafted crowbar into her vehicle before heading out to the diving site. The crowbar didn't seem out of place, what with her being a metal worker and competitively acknowledged for her unique metalwork.\n\nHer performance at work had been nothing short of outstanding, and she had been putting in long, overtime hours. She was highly dedicated to her work and never missed an opportunity to express her ambition for a promotion.\n\nJulian and Clara both worked at the same company, and both had been in the running for the same promotion. During the office water cooler chats, he'd heard Clara express her keen interest in the promotion, and her evident disappointment when Julian became a potential contender.\n\nThe evidence was laid in front of him: a woman with an enthusiastic interest in killers, always reading her crime books even on her lunch breaks, a craftsman with a signature touch on uniquely crafted crowbars, and seen with one on the day of Julian's infamous dive. A metal worker who had been putting in long hours for an impressive performance. All that tied with the delicate balance of coworkers both competing for the same promotion. \n\nOne piece of evidence caught his eye. Clara was also a part of the diving team on the day Julian was murdered. With that, Winston pushed back his chair, stood up, and prepared to pay Clara a visit. He had a feeling there would be more to dig up from her perpetually stacked workspace, files and statements during her interrogation.\n\nWinston stood overlooking the gentle sway of the ocean, the sun reflecting a glaring path of light towards the spot where Julian's body had been found. The dive was a secluded affair, intended just for a small, close-knit group of divers which included Lucy and Julian, often dive partners.\n\nDerailing his thoughts, he flicked through his notes, focusing on Lucy's background - the woman had a varied history, from construction sites to docks, her hand attending to many trades. She'd even taken a boat maintenance course somewhere along the way. A crowbar tool was commonly used in both professions. \n\n\"Detective Winston, Miss Lucy is ready to see you,\" a uniformed officer approached him. \n\n\"Thank you, officer,\" he responded, shaking his head in dismissal, his eyes still on the open files in his hand.\n\nHe walked into the impromptu interview room, eyes finding Lucy easily. She looked out of place in the cold, steel-colored room, her complexion still holding on to the sun-kissed hue from the sail.\n\n\"Lucy,\" Winston began, his tone neutral. \"You and Julian. I've been told you two dive together frequently,\" he watched her face for any signs of reaction.\n\n\"Yes,\" she confirmed curtly. \"Julian and I...we were friends,\" she added before a tight swallow. \"He betrayed my trust though, caused me significant trouble.\"\n\nThat drew his attention. He decided to delve into the more intimate details, \"You were managing the tools for this trip?\"\n\nCaught off guard, Lucy straightened. \"Yes...yes, that's correct. I've always taken care of the gear, packed the crowbar too. Just a precaution...\"\n\n\"I see.

He asked, \"Lucy, did you find any evidence in Julian's belongings?\"\n\n\"I...

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the eerie glow of a laser tag arena, Nelson's life tragically ended with an axe, leaving Detective Winston to navigate a web of deception spun by suspects Mackenzie and Erika.\n\nWinston had barely blinked since he started pouring over the case files. Nelson, the financial auditor, was found murdered at a laser tag arena of all places, and the murder weapon: an axe. This was far from the norm and even stranger was the timing of the murder, coinciding with a laser tag game Nelson had been participating in.\n\nThe local PD had brought in Mackenzie for questioning. Winston noted she wore an expensive watch, as did Nelson. Seems they had more in common than he had first thought.\n\nWinston entered the interrogation room. Mackenzie didn't look up. He started off the conversation as casually as possible.\n\n\"Heard you and Nelson went to play laser tag that very day,\" Winston asked, with a neutral expression.\n\n\"Yeah,\" answered Mackenzie, \"He wanted to blow off some steam after working all day.\"\n\n\"Work must've been tough. Big pressure in the audit department,\" said Winston, maintaining his tone.\n\n\"A lot of discrepancies for sure,\" Mackenzie replied, her voice a tad more serious this time.\n\nInteresting. Winston remembered Nelson had filed a complaint about anomalies with the funds in the company. He had to change the course of the enquiry slightly.\n\n\"I've heard they have some pretty secluded areas in these laser tag arenas. You were spotted heading into one of them shortly before the game during which Nelson was murdered, Mackenzie,\" said Winston, watching her face closely. She took a deep breath before speaking again.\n\n\"I used to work as a lumberjack. I got used to the quiet, you know?\" she responded, her eyes never leaving his. \"Used to throw axes in college as part of a sport, so I also went into those areas to relax when I had time between games.\"\n\nTaking a pause himself, Winston said, \"And this axe you've recently been seen with?\"\n\n\"I took it with me that day,\" she admitted without hesitation. \"Thought some kids might like to see some tricks. Used to show 'em off back in my lumberjack days.\"\n\nWinston nodded, \"You certainly know how to handle one.\"\n\nSuddenly, Winston's phone buzzed with a message. He skimmed through the contents and glanced up at Mackenzie again, now studying her expensive accessories.\n\n\"Mackenzie, you made several large cash deposits recently,\" Winston said, still casual, \"Uncommon for your pay grade, no?\"\n\nA flash of a defensive posture wasn't lost on Winston. But the room remained silent except for his ensuing words.\n\n\"Well, we can get to that later,\" Winston said standing up and walking to the door, \"Take care, Mackenzie.\"\n\nShe nodded, her eyes now transfixed at the solitary light bulb above her.\n\nAfter leaving the room, Winston exhaled a deep breath. He felt a strange energy from Mackenzie...an air of danger and desperation. But he had to stick to the facts, and the facts alone. Destiny, it seemed, had led him down an unusual path indeed.\n\nWinston studied the crime scene report from the laser tag arena. Nelson was the victim this time. His eyebrows narrowed as he looked at the weapon of question - an axe. Quite a strange telling for such a place.\n\nThe next part of Winston’s day led him to Erika, Nelson's travel companion and a former lumberjack champion by trade. Erika was neither surprised by the detective or the fact he wanted to discuss Nelson's demise.\n\n\"Erika and Nelson entered the arena together and you were with him the entire time...,\" he asked in a questioning manner.\n\n\"Yes detective, Nelson and I both arrived together and I never left his side until...,\" she replied in a collected voice.\n\n\"An axe in a laser tag arena...,\" Winston sighed under his breath. Erika's ears seemed to pick on this and she acknowledged the odd presence of the tool.\n\n\"Yes, Detective... I noticed that toolbox. I even commented to Nelson about the axe inside it\". Her lumberjack past echoed slightly in her voice as she spoke.\n\nShe didn't hide that she exhibited high axe-wielding skills - a fact that was common knowledge in her home town. She won numerous lumberjack competitions, after all.\n\nDuring his investigation, Winston also found that Erika had a habit of using a VPN when browsing the internet, and that she cleared her browsing history after each session. He had to smile at this. In an age when everyone displayed their lives on social media, Erika's avoidance of the platform was quite unique. It was something Winston astutely noticed.\n\nConfirming this observation was Gerald, a companion on their recent travel. \"Erika, she's rather private when it comes to the internet. She stays away from social media, and I've seen her clear her browser history after each use,\" he noted in his conversation with Winston.\n\nHe found that confirmed by her college roommate as well. She blushed, then sheepishly said, \"Yeah, Erika never really cared for social media. She's always been a private person.\"\n\n\"Erika, I find it quite peculiar that Nelson was found dead just minutes after you two entered the laser tag arena and were together,\" Winston finally expressed.\n\nErika's gaze shifted slightly at Winston’s last comment but she remained silent, her face a calm mask.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Erika was neither surprised by the detective or the fact he wanted to discuss Nelson's demise.\n\n\"Erika and Nelson entered the arena together and you were with him the entire time...,\" he asked in a questioning manner.\n\n\"Yes detective, Nelson and I both arrived together and I never left his side until...,\" she replied in a collected voice.\n\n\"An axe in a laser tag arena...,\" Winston sighed under his breath. Erika's ears seemed to pick on this and she acknowledged the odd presence of the tool.\n\n\"Yes, Detective... I noticed that toolbox. I even commented to Nelson about the axe inside it\". Her lumberjack past echoed slightly in her voice as she spoke.\n\nShe didn't hide that she exhibited high axe-wielding skills - a fact that was common knowledge in her home town. She won numerous lumberjack competitions, after all.\n\nDuring his investigation, Winston also found that Erika had a habit of using a VPN when browsing the internet, and that she cleared her browsing history after each session. He had to smile at this. In an age when everyone displayed their lives on social media, Erika's avoidance of the platform was quite unique. It was something Winston astutely noticed.\n\nConfirming this observation was Gerald, a companion on their recent travel. \"Erika, she's rather private when it comes to the internet. She stays away from social media, and I've seen her clear her browser history after each use,\" he noted in his conversation with Winston.\n\nHe found that confirmed by her college roommate as well. She blushed, then sheepishly said, \"Yeah, Erika never really cared for social media. She's always been a private person.\"\n\n\"Erika, I find it quite peculiar that Nelson was found dead just minutes after you two entered the laser tag arena and were together,\" Winston finally expressed.\n\nErika's gaze shifted slightly at Winston’s last comment but she remained silent, her face a calm mask.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Detective Winston stared at the dispatch report and heaved a weary sigh. Highlighted information spelled out a sad tale of love, jealousy, and secrets; especially the ones contained in Timothy's silent confession of an argument where Ivan confronted him about the affair with his girlfriend.\n\nAs he entered the studio, a peculiar detail stood out – it was empty when the victim was found. The police had taken the usual preliminary measures, clearing the premises as they went. That detail played a repetitive note in Winston's mind. There was only one name that matched the time of death, Timothy.\n\nBegrudgingly, he agreed to interview Timothy, the victim’s friend and also a surfing instructor by trade. Timothy's van was a shrine to waxed boards of all sizes, shapes, and colors, almost like weapons of battle against the waves. When Winston had asked him about it, Timothy fondly explained that every board had its unique purpose, for each wave and beach condition. His job demanded him to know places, waves, and beaches in intimate detail. One could even notice the envy tinged bitterness in Timothy's voice when he shared his love for discovering new surfing spots and how Ivan’s musical success overshadowed his own aspirations.\n\n“What brings you here, detective?” Timothy's voice cut through Winston's thoughts. “Well, you were last seen here with Ivan. You guys…\"\n\n“Yeah, we were working on a music project together,” Timothy finished Winston's half-spoken question. His face turned a shade darker as he added, “That was our thing, you know. He did the music, I brought the vibe. But everyone always loved Ivan more, even my own girlfriend.”\n\nThere was a certain restlessness in Timothy's manner. His eyes kept darting towards the door, his van in sight. It was always packed and ready; 'to chase the waves,' Timothy had shared during the friendly chit-chat. His resentment towards Ivan had resurfaced, amplified by the fact that Ivan's girlfriend was now in love with him.\n\nWhen Winston mentioned Ivan's girlfriend, Timothy's smile tightened. Yet when he asked about the argument where Ivan had confronted him about the affair, the smile faded away completely. He didn't want to expose sharper edges of their relationship; the complex, fraught friendship woven with threads of rivalry and jealousy. Most of all, there was a looming fear of Ivan revealing their secret affair to the world.\n\nWinston slowly stood up, giving Timothy a knowing look. He thanked him for his time and walked away, leaving an unsettling silence behind him as Timothy sat, staring at the spot where Ivan used to create music. His secret was a festering wound he had no idea how to treat, and the fear of exposure was a haunting melody he couldn't escape.\n\nAt the end of a long day, Winston found himself standing on the bridge, gazing at the dark and unyielding ocean. The carefully collected facts played on repeat, like a song stuck in a loop. He couldn't help but think of Timothy, his passions, his secrets, his fear, his jealousy, and his time at the studio which eerily aligned with the irrevocable end of Ivan's life. A hazy picture began to take form in his mind, but he knew it was far from complete...There were still missing notes in this haunting symphony of death.\n\nDetective Winston stepped out of his car and straightened his tie as he made his way towards the pet shop. An older man stood at the entrance, a look of potential fear and regret on his face. \n\n\"Ricky?\" Winston asked with a raised eyebrow.\n\n\"Depends who's asking,\" Ricky responded, eyeing Winston over. \n\n\"Detective Winston,\" he introduced himself and showed his badge. He noticed a change in Ricky's demeanor. \"Might we have a word regarding your business?\"\n\nRicky, swallowing hard, nodded and gestured to the back room of the pet shop. It was filled with a variety of animals, among them a large, intimidating venomous snake settled in a glass tank, aptly showcased as the shop's specialty.\n\n\"You seem to have quite a variety of pets here, and appropriate paperwork on display. You do legally own this place, don't you?\" Winston asked, pointing at the legal documents hanging on the wall.\n\nRicky, still unsettled, nodded, \"Yes. I also know a bit about venom extraction, which makes this business unique,\" he added with an attempt at lightheartedness. \n\n\"You know, the police got a tip-off about some illegal activity regarding this pet shop,\" Winston continued. Ricky's eyes widened.\n\n\"Why, I've no idea what you're insinuating detective,\" Ricky stuttered, looking like a man who feared impending financial and legal repercussions.\n\n\"Your financial situation hasn't been the best we've heard,\" Winston said, \"and someone named Ivan has been feeding us some rather interesting information regarding your debts.\"\n\n\"Ivan.\" Ricky whispered under his breath.\n\n\"It seems you had a private meeting with Ivan in an empty recording studio,\" Winston revealed, seeing Ricky's surprise at this information. \"That's where he recorded your conversation, and you confessed to some illegal activities, didn't you?\"\n\nRicky looked down and then glanced up, resignation in his eyes. He nodded somberly, \"Yes, Ivan was the only one who knew about the illegal activities... He recorded me talking about the illegal sales and has been blackmailing me with the recording.\"\n\nWinston thanked Ricky for his time and walked out of the pet shop with much to ponder about this case.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nInside the buzzing hubbub of the city's most popular recording studio, Ivan's death by snake venom sends shockwaves through the music realm, forcing the indomitable Detective Winston to pierce the veil of sound and silence, suspects, Timothy and Ricky, echoing in his ears.\n\nThe flashing lights and the police tape painted a macabre picture outside the recording studio where Ivan was pronounced dead. Detective Winston stared at the dispatch report and heaved a weary sigh. Highlighted information spelled out a sad tale of love, jealousy, and secrets; especially the ones contained in Timothy's silent confession of an argument where Ivan confronted him about the affair with his girlfriend.\n\nAs he entered the studio, a peculiar detail stood out – it was empty when the victim was found. The police had taken the usual preliminary measures, clearing the premises as they went. That detail played a repetitive note in Winston's mind. There was only one name that matched the time of death, Timothy.\n\nBegrudgingly, he agreed to interview Timothy, the victim’s friend and also a surfing instructor by trade. Timothy's van was a shrine to waxed boards of all sizes, shapes, and colors, almost like weapons of battle against the waves. When Winston had asked him about it, Timothy fondly explained that every board had its unique purpose, for each wave and beach condition. His job demanded him to know places, waves, and beaches in intimate detail. One could even notice the envy tinged bitterness in Timothy's voice when he shared his love for discovering new surfing spots and how Ivan’s musical success overshadowed his own aspirations.\n\n“What brings you here, detective?” Timothy's voice cut through Winston's thoughts. “Well, you were last seen here with Ivan. You guys…\"\n\n“Yeah, we were working on a music project together,” Timothy finished Winston's half-spoken question. His face turned a shade darker as he added, “That was our thing, you know. He did the music, I brought the vibe. But everyone always loved Ivan more, even my own girlfriend.”\n\nThere was a certain restlessness in Timothy's manner. His eyes kept darting towards the door, his van in sight. It was always packed and ready; 'to chase the waves,' Timothy had shared during the friendly chit-chat. His resentment towards Ivan had resurfaced, amplified by the fact that Ivan's girlfriend was now in love with him.\n\nWhen Winston mentioned Ivan's girlfriend, Timothy's smile tightened. Yet when he asked about the argument where Ivan had confronted him about the affair, the smile faded away completely. He didn't want to expose sharper edges of their relationship; the complex, fraught friendship woven with threads of rivalry and jealousy. Most of all, there was a looming fear of Ivan revealing their secret affair to the world.\n\nWinston slowly stood up, giving Timothy a knowing look. He thanked him for his time and walked away, leaving an unsettling silence behind him as Timothy sat, staring at the spot where Ivan used to create music. His secret was a festering wound he had no idea how to treat, and the fear of exposure was a haunting melody he couldn't escape.\n\nAt the end of a long day, Winston found himself standing on the bridge, gazing at the dark and unyielding ocean. The carefully collected facts played on repeat, like a song stuck in a loop. He couldn't help but think of Timothy, his passions, his secrets, his fear, his jealousy, and his time at the studio which eerily aligned with the irrevocable end of Ivan's life. A hazy picture began to take form in his mind, but he knew it was far from complete...There were still missing notes in this haunting symphony of death.\n\nDetective Winston stepped out of his car and straightened his tie as he made his way towards the pet shop. An older man stood at the entrance, a look of potential fear and regret on his face. \n\n\"Ricky?\" Winston asked with a raised eyebrow.\n\n\"Depends who's asking,\" Ricky responded, eyeing Winston over. \n\n\"Detective Winston,\" he introduced himself and showed his badge. He noticed a change in Ricky's demeanor. \"Might we have a word regarding your business?\"\n\nRicky, swallowing hard, nodded and gestured to the back room of the pet shop. It was filled with a variety of animals, among them a large, intimidating venomous snake settled in a glass tank, aptly showcased as the shop's specialty.\n\n\"You seem to have quite a variety of pets here, and appropriate paperwork on display. You do legally own this place, don't you?\" Winston asked, pointing at the legal documents hanging on the wall.\n\nRicky, still unsettled, nodded, \"Yes. I also know a bit about venom extraction, which makes this business unique,\" he added with an attempt at lightheartedness. \n\n\"You know, the police got a tip-off about some illegal activity regarding this pet shop,\" Winston continued. Ricky's eyes widened.\n\n\"Why, I've no idea what you're insinuating detective,\" Ricky stuttered, looking like a man who feared impending financial and legal repercussions.\n\n\"Your financial situation hasn't been the best we've heard,\" Winston said, \"and someone named Ivan has been feeding us some rather interesting information regarding your debts.\"\n\n\"Ivan.\" Ricky whispered under his breath.\n\n\"It seems you had a private meeting with Ivan in an empty recording studio,\" Winston revealed, seeing Ricky's surprise at this information. \"That's where he recorded your conversation, and you confessed to some illegal activities, didn't you?\"\n\nRicky looked down and then glanced up, resignation in his eyes. He nodded somberly, \"Yes, Ivan was the only one who knew about the illegal activities... He recorded me talking about the illegal sales and has been blackmailing me with the recording.\"\n\nWinston thanked Ricky for his time and walked out of the pet shop with much to ponder about this case. One thing was certain - the recording studio where Ricky made his confession was going to be his next stop.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Timothy\nB.

He had a slight headache after a long day of looking into the mysterious death of a lady called Iris. A sad story really, she was a frequent visitor at the casino, she had the luck of a devil. She often walked out of that place with a smile on her face and a hefty amount in her purse...until the night she didn't walk out at all.\n\nSifting through the evidence, Winston's hand found an envelope labeled 'Confidential.' Inside, there was a recorded statement Iris had given to a trusted friend a few days before her death. Iris clearly expressed her intention to report Christine at her next police visit.\n\nThe only real link he had to the case so far was Christine. Christine was a solid, muscular woman who worked long hours at a construction site. It wasn't just her construction job that kept her fit, it was also the time she spent with Iris working on a shared construction project. It was during these long hours they spent together that they built a strong association, a teamwork which often led them to the casino.\n\nChristine, during one of their teamwork endeavors revealed to Iris her involvement in certain illicit activities. Iris, shocked by this revelation, clearly intended to report these activities to the police, a fact she expressed in the recorded statement Winston now held in his hands.\n\nAnother peculiar detail, a lead pipe -- the same type as the murder weapon -- was discovered at Christine and Iris's collective work site. Christine certainly had the brawn to wield that pipe.\n\nWinston flipped open the file and spread out the still shots from the casino's surveillance footage. A timestamp in the corner corroborated with his notes -- Christine was present at the casino the night of the murder.\n\nThe police station was quiet as he entered Christine's holding cell. The woman looked tense but tried to put up a brave front.\n\n\"Spending a lot of time at the casino and the construction site these days?\" He asked.\n\n\"Sure, ever since Iris and I started working on that project together. We often celebrated our small victories at the casino\" Christine's voice choked a bit on her friend's name.\n\n\"And during those hours you told Iris about your...extra-curricular activities?\" Winston pressed further. Christine didn't deny it, remained silent.\n\n\"Iris had planned to turn you in you know?\" Winston said coolly, fanning out the recorded statement. \"This was her intention during her upcoming visit to the police station.\"\n\nChristine didn't respond, just locked her gaze onto Winston's.\n\n\"I noticed a lead pipe lying around your shared construction site, identical to the murder weapon,\" he pushed further. \"Now, Christine, what else did you two discuss when you were working on those projects?\"\n\nWinston sat back, letting his words linger in the chill air of the interview room. The pieces of the puzzle were slowly falling into place, but the game was far from over.\n\nDetective Winston scoured through the casino surveillance footage once again, his grim reflection faintly visible on the monitor screen. There was Madison, peering into what looked like a 'souvenir' box, a curious mix of nostalgia and uncertainty etched on their face. Not a lead, but perhaps another piece of the puzzle.\n\nA separate clip caught Winston's eye, revealing Iris within the casino, merrily wagering lady luck amidst a sea of other gamblers. Iris and Madison under the same roof. It made sense something had transpired, but it was not his place yet to jump to conclusions.\n\nSubsequent investigation took Winston to Madison's apartment. Reports had come in that they were often seen witnessing Iris's Friday night departures for the casino. Madison, it seemed, had an insight into Iris's late-night gambling endeavors, if only because they both shared the same neighborhood.\n\nA new twist arrived in the form of an overheard conversation. Madison, just within earshot of Winston's position, seemed to be reminiscing about overhearing Iris's tales of the casino's allure. It didn't boost the investigation, but it added an interesting dynamic.\n\nAs the day wore on, Winston moved to the next building with a lead. Madison, seen using a key to enter the previous tenant's apartment, raised some questions. On being questioned about possessing this particular key, Madison nostalgically said, \"Ah, such memories.\" The janitor confirmed that Madison had indeed requested a copy of the previous occupant's keys. A favor for an old friend or something more sinister?\n\nThe detective moved his inquiry to the legal hullabaloo that suddenly had Iris at the heart of it. Surveillance footage showed her in the courthouse with an armful of court documents. Iris was no ordinary casino patron but a key witness in a court case directly linked to Madison's illegal activities. This implied a new layer of complication to their association.\n\nLegal terms printed on an eviction notice in Madison's possession stated that any illegal activities could lead to immediate eviction. Madison, having received this, was acutely aware of the implications of Iris' testimony.  A visit to the casino and the courthouse, another twist in the tale, was when Madison's lawyer had to break the news to their client about Iris's damning testimony.\n\nBut for Winston, there was still a bunch of questions left unanswered, and the jigsaw was only half complete. The investigation had to dig deeper. There was a long day ahead.

The pieces of the puzzle were slowly falling into place, but the game was far from over.\n\nDetective Winston scoured through the casino surveillance footage once again, his grim reflection faintly visible on the monitor screen. There was Madison, peering into what looked like a 'souvenir' box, a curious mix of nostalgia and uncertainty etched on their face. Not a lead, but perhaps another piece of the puzzle.\n\nA separate clip caught Winston's eye, revealing Iris within the casino, merrily wagering lady luck amidst a sea of other gamblers. Iris and Madison under the same roof. It made sense something had transpired, but it was not his place yet to jump to conclusions.\n\nSubsequent investigation took Winston to Madison's apartment. Reports had come in that they were often seen witnessing Iris's Friday night departures for the casino. Madison, it seemed, had an insight into Iris's late-night gambling endeavors, if only because they both shared the same neighborhood.\n\nA new twist arrived in the form of an overheard conversation. Madison, just within earshot of Winston's position, seemed to be reminiscing about overhearing Iris's tales of the casino's allure. It didn't boost the investigation, but it added an interesting dynamic.\n\nAs the day wore on, Winston moved to the next building with a lead. Madison, seen using a key to enter the previous tenant's apartment, raised some questions. On being questioned about possessing this particular key, Madison nostalgically said, \"Ah, such memories.\" The janitor confirmed that Madison had indeed requested a copy of the previous occupant's keys. A favor for an old friend or something more sinister?\n\nThe detective moved his inquiry to the legal hullabaloo that suddenly had Iris at the heart of it. Surveillance footage showed her in the courthouse with an armful of court documents. Iris was no ordinary casino patron but a key witness in a court case directly linked to Madison's illegal activities. This implied a new layer of complication to their association.\n\nLegal terms printed on an eviction notice in Madison's possession stated that any illegal activities could lead to immediate eviction. Madison, having received this, was acutely aware of the implications of Iris' testimony.  A visit to the casino and the courthouse, another twist in the tale, was when Madison's lawyer had to break the news to their client about Iris's damning testimony.\n\nBut for Winston, there was still a bunch of questions left unanswered, and the jigsaw was only half complete. The investigation had to dig deeper. There was a long day ahead. Pieces were moving, and Winston knew well enough in this game; nothing moved without a reason.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Madison\nB.

The crime scene images were grim; a body dumped in a swamp, a fatal dose of bleach poisoning seemingly the cause. Poor Ricky still wore the glazed-over look of surprise. The thick morass of the swamp had been the final resting place for a man who, not more than a few hours ago, was alive and bound for a visit to his dentist, Glenn.\n\nWinston put away the photos and dialed Glenn's office. A swift answer came from an exhausted receptionist, barely managing to croak out that the clinic was nearing insolvency. She lamented over her situation, without pay for days, and wondering if she'd be paid at all. Winston could feel something wasn't right. He thanked the receptionist and prepared himself for a visit.\n\nUpon arrival to the clinic, the tools of Glenn's trade laid out on a steel tray caught his eye. Among the collection of dental paraphernalia was a large bottle of bleach, no doubt used for sterilizing his instruments. Winston studied the peculiar tall man standing before him, Glenn, a dentist by profession. A professional known to have chosen forensic odontology as a specialty—a pocket of expertise not many in his field would aspire to occupy.\n\n\"Now that's an intriguing line of work, Glenn,\" Winston remarked. Glenn gave a shrug and an almost shy nod before further adding, \"I like to keep curious, Detective. I find toxicology talks within dental science forums quite engaging.\" \n\nWinston made polite conversation, shifting discussion towards Ricky. \"I take it he was in your care recently?\"\n\nWith a hint of sadness, Glenn responded, \"Yes, he only left here yesterday. He had some work required before the holidays.\"\n\nBefore leaving, Winston inquired about Glenn's morning activities, \"I hear you're an avid bird watcher, Glenn?\"\n\nLaughing, Glenn replied, \"Yes, Detective! Nothing like the soft chirping of birds at the break of dawn. I have been birdwatching by, funny enough, the swamp, this very morning.\"\n\nThe detective then revealed a rather puzzling piece of information, he had uncovered during his investigation. \"Ricky was found dead in the very swamp, you were birdwatching today, killed by bleach,\" he stated matter-of-factly.\n\nGlenn looked genuinely shell-shocked; fear slowly seeping into his gaze. Sensing his discomfort, Winston decided to leave him with one last piece of information, \"One more thing, Glenn. Ricky had you listed as the beneficiary on his life insurance policy.\" Winston held out the document from his satchel, showing Glenn the listed beneficent's name was indeed his.\n\n\"And just last week you mentioned the high monetary benefits that such a policy could bring in, didn't you, Glenn?\" Winston added, watching the shock travel from Glenn's face to his very feet.\n\nNot waiting for an answer, Winston turned and left the dental clinic, leaving Glenn to his thoughts.\n\nWinston wrinkled his nose at the pungent odour of the swamp. Someone had found Ricky's body among the overgrown weeds and murky waters. An unfortunate end he mused, standing within walking distance of the local prison nearby. As he prepared to interview a potentially connected party — Tessa, a chemistry teacher turned inmate, he ran over the facts in his mind. \n\nHer current occupation as a cleaner in the prison's system gave her access to various supplies, cleaning supplies in particular. There were rumours of her unauthorized experiments involving bleach which had spiralled her into trouble once. Moreover, she worked on a farm near this very swamp.\n\nWalking through the steel encased hallways of the prison, Winston arrived at Tessa's workspace. Finding her face damp with sweat, the persistent clang of her efforts to clean reverberated in the small and dank concrete space. She paused when he called her, \"Tessa,\" Winston began, his tone crisp and official. \"I'm detective Winston. I understand you taught chemistry before your unfortunate incarceration.\" \n\n\"Yeah, I did. Is my knowledge of chemistry a crime now too?\" Tessa paused,-looking at him expectantly. \n\n\"Investigating a crime scene, Ricky's body was found in a nearby swamp,\" Winston continued ignoring her comments. \"Awfully close to the prison farm you've been working on.\"\n\nShe made no visible reaction to the news. Then crossed her arms, furrowing her brows. \"What's that got to do with any of this? And why should I know him? There are hundreds of prisoners passing through these cells...\"\n\nIgnoring her defensive stance, Winston targeted a more interesting topic, \"Word has it you've been passionately sharing some rather unique dreams with your cell mates?\" \n\nTessa stared at Winston blankly, and then nodded. \"Yeah, dreams... dreams of dying.

The thick morass of the swamp had been the final resting place for a man who, not more than a few hours ago, was alive and bound for a visit to his dentist, Glenn.\n\nWinston put away the photos and dialed Glenn's office. A swift answer came from an exhausted receptionist, barely managing to croak out that the clinic was nearing insolvency. She lamented over her situation, without pay for days, and wondering if she'd be paid at all. Winston could feel something wasn't right. He thanked the receptionist and prepared himself for a visit.\n\nUpon arrival to the clinic, the tools of Glenn's trade laid out on a steel tray caught his eye. Among the collection of dental paraphernalia was a large bottle of bleach, no doubt used for sterilizing his instruments. Winston studied the peculiar tall man standing before him, Glenn, a dentist by profession. A professional known to have chosen forensic odontology as a specialty—a pocket of expertise not many in his field would aspire to occupy.\n\n\"Now that's an intriguing line of work, Glenn,\" Winston remarked. Glenn gave a shrug and an almost shy nod before further adding, \"I like to keep curious, Detective. I find toxicology talks within dental science forums quite engaging.\" \n\nWinston made polite conversation, shifting discussion towards Ricky. \"I take it he was in your care recently?\"\n\nWith a hint of sadness, Glenn responded, \"Yes, he only left here yesterday. He had some work required before the holidays.\"\n\nBefore leaving, Winston inquired about Glenn's morning activities, \"I hear you're an avid bird watcher, Glenn?\"\n\nLaughing, Glenn replied, \"Yes, Detective! Nothing like the soft chirping of birds at the break of dawn. I have been birdwatching by, funny enough, the swamp, this very morning.\"\n\nThe detective then revealed a rather puzzling piece of information, he had uncovered during his investigation. \"Ricky was found dead in the very swamp, you were birdwatching today, killed by bleach,\" he stated matter-of-factly.\n\nGlenn looked genuinely shell-shocked; fear slowly seeping into his gaze. Sensing his discomfort, Winston decided to leave him with one last piece of information, \"One more thing, Glenn. Ricky had you listed as the beneficiary on his life insurance policy.\" Winston held out the document from his satchel, showing Glenn the listed beneficent's name was indeed his.\n\n\"And just last week you mentioned the high monetary benefits that such a policy could bring in, didn't you, Glenn?\" Winston added, watching the shock travel from Glenn's face to his very feet.\n\nNot waiting for an answer, Winston turned and left the dental clinic, leaving Glenn to his thoughts.\n\nWinston wrinkled his nose at the pungent odour of the swamp. Someone had found Ricky's body among the overgrown weeds and murky waters. An unfortunate end he mused, standing within walking distance of the local prison nearby. As he prepared to interview a potentially connected party — Tessa, a chemistry teacher turned inmate, he ran over the facts in his mind. \n\nHer current occupation as a cleaner in the prison's system gave her access to various supplies, cleaning supplies in particular. There were rumours of her unauthorized experiments involving bleach which had spiralled her into trouble once. Moreover, she worked on a farm near this very swamp.\n\nWalking through the steel encased hallways of the prison, Winston arrived at Tessa's workspace. Finding her face damp with sweat, the persistent clang of her efforts to clean reverberated in the small and dank concrete space. She paused when he called her, \"Tessa,\" Winston began, his tone crisp and official. \"I'm detective Winston. I understand you taught chemistry before your unfortunate incarceration.\" \n\n\"Yeah, I did. Is my knowledge of chemistry a crime now too?\" Tessa paused,-looking at him expectantly. \n\n\"Investigating a crime scene, Ricky's body was found in a nearby swamp,\" Winston continued ignoring her comments. \"Awfully close to the prison farm you've been working on.\"\n\nShe made no visible reaction to the news. Then crossed her arms, furrowing her brows. \"What's that got to do with any of this? And why should I know him? There are hundreds of prisoners passing through these cells...\"\n\nIgnoring her defensive stance, Winston targeted a more interesting topic, \"Word has it you've been passionately sharing some rather unique dreams with your cell mates?\" \n\nTessa stared at Winston blankly, and then nodded. \"Yeah, dreams... dreams of dying. Dreams of new beginnings. Awfully real. I don't know why, but I felt compelled to share them, almost eagerly. Figured I needed some context to these vivid dreams, so I started visiting the prison library often.\"\n\n\"In the sections about spiritualism, death rituals, and reincarnation, I believe? Parts of the sections involving death and the afterlife?\" Winston queried.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right. It soothes me, somehow,\" Tessa shrugged, resuming her duties.\n\nLeaving her to her cleaning, he walked away, the vestiges of the swamp carrying a far more sinister weight now.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Sighing, he prepared himself to go and speak to Sam, a schoolmate of Jesse with a connection to landscaping tools.\n\nArriving at \"Green Leaves Landscaping\", Winston was greeted by the bustling noise of various gardening equipment being operated for demonstrations and repairs. He looked around, noting that this place even had lawnmowers, one in particular stood out.\n\nHe was introduced to Sam. The young man, not much older than Jesse, who seemed jittery and nervous. No doubt upset about his friend's death. \n\n\"Sam, right?\" Winston asked, to which the young man just nodded. \n\n\"Bit of a strange question, but do you know how to operate a lawnmower?\" Winston asked.\n\nA slight nod from Sam confirmed it, \"Yeah, on top of that I passed my course in operating heavy machinery with distinction last summer. I know my way around from lawnmowers to bulldozers.\" \n\nWinston continued with a gentle but probing conversation, leading to Sam mentioning the school field trip to the rainforest that had turned tragic. This sparked another question from Winston. \n\n\"Anyone else in that rainforest, apart from your school group?\" The answer was negative.\n\nThe conversation took a dramatic turn when Sam admitted to finding some inappropriate texts between Jesse and his girlfriend on her phone, showing them to Winston. \n\n\"And she admitted to it?\" Winston pursued, brows furrowed. \"Yes, she confessed when confronted.\" Sam's voice choked up a little.\n\nTaking a mental step back, Winston continued with his questions, \"Your father owns this place?\" \n\nSam's hand gestured around the landscape store run by his father, \"Yeah, been helping him around whenever I'm free.\"\n\nThey chatted for a couple more minutes before Winston thanked Sam for his time and left, informing him that they might need to speak again. He reflected on what he'd learned, about Jesse's cheating, Sam’s landscaping connection and distinction-honored ability to operate heavy machinery. The facts were taking shape in a complex web, beginning to form a picture but with still much to be discovered.\n\nWinston adjusted his fedora and walked into Steve's study in the local synagogue, filled with ancient religious texts, some open and spread out in front of Steve. Steve looked like a man deep in thought, his eyes fixated on the book in front of him. \n\n\"Mind if I interrupt, Rabbi Steve?\" Winston asked, interrupting the tranquility. \n\n\"Detective Winston,\" Steve acknowledged without lifting his eyes. His voice reflected his years, a baritone stained with wisdom. \n\n\"I understand you were meant to be at a number of religious events, which this community is known for, but it appears you were missing in action?\" Winston probed lightly, trying to placate the simmering tension he could already sense. \n\n\"I've been studying, Detective. These ancient religious texts are complicated and require my full attention, and I couldn't divide it between them and the ritualistic gatherings.\" Steve finally looked up, his gaze piercing through Winston.\n\nSteve's intense lifestyle of a lot of reading and self-study was no secret to the detective. This was his daily routine.\n\n\"I understand.\" Winston pulled out his notepad, shifting in his seat. \"You regularly volunteer for the forest clean-ups, correct?\" \n\n\"Every chance I get,\" Steve responded, his volunteer spirit evident in his voice. The rain forest thundered just beyond the confines of Steve's synagogue, a song of life against the urban creep.

And at the same time, you're losing a bunch of yours.”\n\n\"Coincidence,\" Steve shrugged it off.\n\n\"Is it? Or do you suspect Jessie was intentionally stealing your client base?\" Winston asked, knowing that Jesse undercutting his rival's price wasn't helping Steve a great deal.\n\n\"Talk to the forest, Detective,\" Steve sighed. “I have more pressing matters to attend to,” Steve said finishing the conversation. \n\nAs Winston got up to leave, he asked off-handedly, \"Was the synagogue typically open during those religious events?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Steve confirmed. \"It was open to all.\"\n\n\"Thank you for your time, Rabbi Steve,\" Winston offered a curt nod and left Steve to his ancient texts requiring deep concentration, and shadows while the rainforest sang beyond.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the aftermath of a devastating home explosion that claims the life of Angela, seasoned Detective Winston hones in on two prime suspects: Patrick and Alvin.\n\nDetective Winston winced a little as he pulled up to Angela's home. What was once a well kept, welcoming residence was now charred remains. All due to an explosion powerful enough to shake the neighborhood. As he began his investigation into the events leading up to the incident, one name kept surfacing: Patrick, local surfing instructor and part-time demolition worker who frequently had to handle, use, and was often training on disposing explosives at his job as a requirement of safety measures.\n \nTo understand this suspect more, Winston set off to meet the man at his next surfing lesson. Under the blistering sun, Patrick was there, quick to anger, bellowing at his students who seemed more frightened than focused on the waves. Several students have had grievances about his harsh teaching methods, which translated to Winston as a lack of patience.\n\nWhen the session started, Winston noticed the scar that ran down the side of his face which looked ill-treated. Patrick noticed him too. His tall and sturdy figure smirked and sauntered towards Winston. \"Detective, right?\" his voice was rough, like sandpaper against a rough surface. \"Heard about Angela, disturbing really.\" \n\nPatrick's nonchalance bothered Winston, but he gave an understanding nod. \"Yeah, it is. You were doing demolition work part-time, handling and using explosives, and even have been frequently training on disposing of them, right? That could surely be a dangerous work, isn't it?\" Winston queried.\n\n\"Sure is,\" Patrick answered, side-glancing towards his students who were still trying to catch a wave, \"Just like surfing, you know, it's all about control.\" \n\nLater, Winston found out from the old records that Patrick once worked in a prison. An inmate had assaulted him, and despite being injured, he'd managed to subdue the prisoner. The incident had left him off fieldwork due to minor injuries, but his bravery had been noted. \n\nWinston also learned that Patrick borrowed a large sum of money from Angela. A neighbor heard Angela frequently threatening to call the cops on Patrick, but he was always around. Patrick had been seen near Angela's home that evening, the very scene of the explosion. There were no others found in the vicinity at the time.\n\nNow, it seemed Winston was dealing with a surfing instructor who vented his frustrations on his students, an injured prison-personnel-turned-demolition-worker with frequent training on handling and disposing explosives who borrowed heavily from a woman who is now dead and was glimpsed around her house before the explosion. Interesting, certainly, but Winston knew there was more to uncover before any real pieces could begin to fall into place here. This was just the start.\n\nWinston sat in his car, surveying through the battered fence that surrounded Angela's suburban home. The yellow tape marking off the scene of the crime fluttered eerily in the wind. Within that marked perimeter was devastation... an explosion had taken place there recently.\n\nAs Winston stepped out of his vehicle, a mail truck adorned with cheerful, vibrant colors pulled up to a house down the street. It was Alvin, a well-liked figure in the community, known best for his calm demeanor and reliability. Ex-military, he was now a delivery man and today, just like every day, he was doing his rounds. Along with the rumors of Alvin's unusual fascination with Angela and his tendency to lurk outside her home during unexpected hours, several witnesses had observed Alvin frequently retreating to his garage, where he kept a collection of various artifacts, including explosives and old photos of Angela.\n\nAlvin had scheduled stops all over the neighborhood, but Angela - the victim in Winston's case - was one that he had on his list daily. It was on Alvin's delivery sheet that day too - a package was scheduled for Angela's house. Always punctual, Alvin would hand-deliver packages to Angela; she was always home to receive them, waiting for him at her front door with a box of his old photos of her flashed to Alvin’s mind. \n\nAngela's old housekeeper clued Winston in on something else. She sat, frail and teary-eyed, as she told him that Angela had recently filed a restraining order against Alvin. Despite this, he continued to visit her home with deliveries daily, revealing a persistence that bordered on stalking. \n\n\"I learned about a lot of things in the army, Winston. How to survive on tinned beans, how to make a fire, how to assemble a rifle... Yes, I might have learnt a bit about explosives too, and have some at my place, but they're never intended for any harm,\" Alvin responds, visibly tense.\n\nWinston catches sight of the mail truck and the single, small box addressed to Angela seated in the front. It was clear the last delivery of the day was made to her and it was also known that Angela was there to receive it. Angela's neighbor, Mrs. Higgins, a nosy old lady who saw everything on the block had testified to Angela personally receiving the parcel at around the same time the explosion incident occurred.\n\nLong after Winston had left, Alvin continued to stare at the spot where Winston had been sitting, his calm exterior shattered. With dread, he remembered the package marked \"explosive\" in his garage, along with a stack of Angela's old photos, and the parcel he had delivered just days before Angela's house had gone up in flames.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Within that marked perimeter was devastation... an explosion had taken place there recently.\n\nAs Winston stepped out of his vehicle, a mail truck adorned with cheerful, vibrant colors pulled up to a house down the street. It was Alvin, a well-liked figure in the community, known best for his calm demeanor and reliability. Ex-military, he was now a delivery man and today, just like every day, he was doing his rounds. Along with the rumors of Alvin's unusual fascination with Angela and his tendency to lurk outside her home during unexpected hours, several witnesses had observed Alvin frequently retreating to his garage, where he kept a collection of various artifacts, including explosives and old photos of Angela.\n\nAlvin had scheduled stops all over the neighborhood, but Angela - the victim in Winston's case - was one that he had on his list daily. It was on Alvin's delivery sheet that day too - a package was scheduled for Angela's house. Always punctual, Alvin would hand-deliver packages to Angela; she was always home to receive them, waiting for him at her front door with a box of his old photos of her flashed to Alvin’s mind. \n\nAngela's old housekeeper clued Winston in on something else. She sat, frail and teary-eyed, as she told him that Angela had recently filed a restraining order against Alvin. Despite this, he continued to visit her home with deliveries daily, revealing a persistence that bordered on stalking. \n\n\"I learned about a lot of things in the army, Winston. How to survive on tinned beans, how to make a fire, how to assemble a rifle... Yes, I might have learnt a bit about explosives too, and have some at my place, but they're never intended for any harm,\" Alvin responds, visibly tense.\n\nWinston catches sight of the mail truck and the single, small box addressed to Angela seated in the front. It was clear the last delivery of the day was made to her and it was also known that Angela was there to receive it. Angela's neighbor, Mrs. Higgins, a nosy old lady who saw everything on the block had testified to Angela personally receiving the parcel at around the same time the explosion incident occurred.\n\nLong after Winston had left, Alvin continued to stare at the spot where Winston had been sitting, his calm exterior shattered. With dread, he remembered the package marked \"explosive\" in his garage, along with a stack of Angela's old photos, and the parcel he had delivered just days before Angela's house had gone up in flames.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

A woman known for her fastidiousness and deft hands in crafting seamless events. \n\nIn a recent chat with Charlotte before her wedding, she mentioned a peculiar detail regarding a certain secret she was advised by Xenia to keep hidden - her past relationship with Xenia's current partner. It was a secret she was planning to unveil at the altar, a revelation that would surely raise a few eyebrows, with Xenia no longer being the lone keeper of it.\n\n\"Ms. Xenia, I presume?\" Winston asked, entering the wedding planner's office. \n\n\"Yes.

It was clear that the jab about Charlotte's intention to confess the past, which involved Xenia's significant other, had struck a nerve. The anger simmering in Xenia's eyes was volatile and intense, enough to make anyone uncomfortable.\n\nAs they conversed, Winston's attention drifted to an office closet, slightly ajar. A suitcase peeked from within, stuffed with neatly folded clothes, almost as though it was constantly ready for a trip. His colleagues had often mentioned seeing this suitcase during their routine meetings with Xenia.\n\n\"Ever much of a traveler, Xenia?\" Winston asked casually. \n\nShe seemed taken aback by his question. \"Sometimes... it's part of the job. Last minute trips for a desired decoration, or perhaps to get a gift. Weekend trips and all.\"\n\n\"That your suitcase in the closet, always packed and ready?\" Winston nodded towards it. Xenia followed his gaze toward the suitcase, then back at him. \"Yes, why?\" \n\n\"No reason,\" Winston shrugged. \"It’s just that colleagues have mentioned spotting you with your luggage at the airport, and at the train station buying tickets – during work hours.\"\n\n\"Yeah, like I said, travelling becomes part of the job sometimes,” countered Xenia, smoothly.\n\nThroughout their conversation about wedding preparations, Xenia specified that she was responsible for every minute detail – setting up and breaking down the décor, liaising with the temple people, overseeing every aspect of the event. She emphasized that her duties required her presence before, during, and after the ceremony. Winston mentally jotted this down, noticing how neatly these timings coincided with those of Charlotte's unfortunate fate.\n\nWinston rose to depart, conveying his gratitude, \"Thanks for your time.\"\n\n\"Of course, anything to help,\" Xenia replied softly. “Charlotte's passing is shocking, but remember, we rely on trust and reputation in our business. It's all we have. Charlotte's confession could have marred that.\"\n\nDetective Winston sifted through the papers littering his desk. Crime scene photos mixed with witness statements and information on both the victim, Charlotte, and the potential suspect, Priscilla. Winston ran a hand through his hair, taking a deep breath.\n\nEyewitness accounts placed Priscilla at the temple on the day of the crime. The same temple where Charlotte was found, her life taken by barbed wire. Winston's gaze drifted towards some photos of the hiking trails Priscilla was known to frequent. The trails, all too often, wound their way past the same temple where Charlotte met her end.\n\nPushing the papers around, Winston found a report from the local police.

Winston mused, barbed wire was indeed common along these trails - so much so that Priscilla had even learned to utilize items like it in her own survival knowledge on these hiking expeditions. \n\nA picture of Priscilla hiking caught Winston's attention. He noted the pair of wire snips she carried. Those would be potentially useful in dealing with the surplus of barbed wire on her usual trails. He also noted the rough timeline on the police report. Charlotte's time of death matched up too neatly with the time witnesses had spotted Priscilla at the temple that day.\n\n\"Interesting, isn't it?\" Winston muttered to himself, mulling over the facts at hand.

Xenia followed his gaze toward the suitcase, then back at him. \"Yes, why?\" \n\n\"No reason,\" Winston shrugged. \"It’s just that colleagues have mentioned spotting you with your luggage at the airport, and at the train station buying tickets – during work hours.\"\n\n\"Yeah, like I said, travelling becomes part of the job sometimes,” countered Xenia, smoothly.\n\nThroughout their conversation about wedding preparations, Xenia specified that she was responsible for every minute detail – setting up and breaking down the décor, liaising with the temple people, overseeing every aspect of the event. She emphasized that her duties required her presence before, during, and after the ceremony. Winston mentally jotted this down, noticing how neatly these timings coincided with those of Charlotte's unfortunate fate.\n\nWinston rose to depart, conveying his gratitude, \"Thanks for your time.\"\n\n\"Of course, anything to help,\" Xenia replied softly. “Charlotte's passing is shocking, but remember, we rely on trust and reputation in our business. It's all we have. Charlotte's confession could have marred that.\"\n\nDetective Winston sifted through the papers littering his desk. Crime scene photos mixed with witness statements and information on both the victim, Charlotte, and the potential suspect, Priscilla. Winston ran a hand through his hair, taking a deep breath.\n\nEyewitness accounts placed Priscilla at the temple on the day of the crime. The same temple where Charlotte was found, her life taken by barbed wire. Winston's gaze drifted towards some photos of the hiking trails Priscilla was known to frequent. The trails, all too often, wound their way past the same temple where Charlotte met her end.\n\nPushing the papers around, Winston found a report from the local police. Priscilla's involvement with certain gang activities was far from a well-kept secret. The faded gang tattoos on Priscilla's skin were testament to her affiliation. Charlotte, on the other hand, was part of a rival gang, a fact anyone could see from the tags she left behind. \n\nPhotos from the trails Priscilla often hiked showed a significant amount of barbed wire fencing. Winston mused, barbed wire was indeed common along these trails - so much so that Priscilla had even learned to utilize items like it in her own survival knowledge on these hiking expeditions. \n\nA picture of Priscilla hiking caught Winston's attention. He noted the pair of wire snips she carried. Those would be potentially useful in dealing with the surplus of barbed wire on her usual trails. He also noted the rough timeline on the police report. Charlotte's time of death matched up too neatly with the time witnesses had spotted Priscilla at the temple that day.\n\n\"Interesting, isn't it?\" Winston muttered to himself, mulling over the facts at hand. Pushing his chair back, he decided it was time to ask Priscilla some questions. He was determined to learn the truth, one piece of evidence at a time.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Priscilla\nB.

Or at least as well as could be hoped for, considering the troubling news,\" she replied, her worry lines dominating her once youthful face. \n\nPushing through the clutter of children's toys, books, and pictures that decorated her home, Winston made a note of the degree in childcare on her mantel. He knew Penelope had dedicated the last decade of her life to working with children, a job she loved, but one that would undoubtedly be threatened if her past felonies were exposed. Kaylee, the young girl whose diary lay open on Winston's desk, had found out about Penelope's criminal past and had penned an entry declaring a plan to tell her parents.\n\nWinston glanced at his notepad, the flowery script of Kaylee's last diary entry etched in his mind - a firm promise to meet Penelope, distinctly noting the abandoned factory as their rendezvous point.\n\nPenelope paced around the room, her eyes darting every so often to the letter box then nervously to the quiet street.

Her home, uncomfortably close to the abandoned factory, the proposed murder site - a chilling silhouette in the skyline.\n\n\"Tell me, besides your childcare work, do you have any other jobs?\" Winston prompted, the area devoid of possible appointments that could conflict with Kaylee's final diary entry.\n\nPenelope quickly redirected the conversation to her upcoming PTA meeting, missing Winston's pointed gaze.\n\nLeaving, Winston secretly carried a nagging thought - an unusual rumor of Penelope cleaning and preparing bodies at the local morgue. This peculiar deviation from her childcare routine was more disconcerting considering Penelope had no formal training in mortuary science.\n\nAs he left, Winston cast one final glance at the pickaxe, a haunting replica of the murder weapon according to his sources. The grim reality hung in the air, the connection between Penelope and the despicable crime seemed to be solidifying.\n\n\"Thank you, Detective Winston, for stopping by,\" Penelope said, her voice shaking slightly. \"But I must see myself to bed.\"\n\n\"Of course, Miss Penelope.

A cascade of secrets lurking beneath the veneer of a dedicated nanny.\n\nThe morning after the murder of Kaylee started off as a whirlwind for Winston. The crime scene was an eerie desolate factory where Francis used to work. A connection that seemed too coincidental to disregard. Winston swiftly sought Francis out for questioning.\n\nFrancis was no stranger, as Winston had previously seen him mingling in town that very day the murder occurred. He'd also seen Francis buying a pickaxe in a supplies shop, a memory strikingly pungent with the horror of the murder tied with the same tool. He had also witnessed Francis fervently striking up conversation about his time spent mining, casually showcasing his familiarity with pickaxes as he described his former job. An interesting aspect that loomed heavily in Winston's mind due to the bludgeoned corpse back at the factory wielding undeniable traces of the tool's involvement.\n\nAs they approached the front door of Francis' rustic house, Winston's attention was pulled towards a curious receipt stuck out from the pocket of Francis' loose fitting jeans: it was for a pickaxe. Francis offered a nonchalant laugh, clarifying with a hint of pride that he still had some use for the tool now and then.\n\nFrancis hesitated for a moment when his daughter appeared in the doorway. A girl who Winston knew to visit Francis during weekends. She was also a regular at the town's therapy sessions, scars from the same etched in her gaze. Earlier that day, Winston had seen Kaylee, her face all aggression and fury, towered over the petite figure of the young girl.\n\nAs Francis placed a gently protective arm around his daughter, Winston took note of her wary gaze. This wasn't a fact that Francis had ever explicitly confessed, but the girl's friends had mentioned it to Winston, gravely, on the sidelines of a school event they'd all been attending.\n\nFrancis led the detective to a casual sitting room, recounting stories of his mining days, claiming that he mentioned the factory, now a crime scene, to his friends just two days back. With this, and his frequent visits to the factory serving as a silent ominous backdrop beyond the modest home, the connections seemed to darken. Winston found himself recalling the parent-teacher meetings he'd seen Francis in attendance of, granted with the soiling sense of urgency that had been bustling beneath his concerned mannerism.\n\nFrancis seemed to grow increasingly exhausted as the day wore on.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nWhen Mack's life got fatally bleached out on a soccer field, it was up to Detective Winston to sift through the dark clues left by his suspects: Helen and Danielle.\n\nWinston stared at the crime scene in front of him. The soccer field's lush greenery was marred by the gruesome sight of Mack's lifeless body. His bleached face was contorted in an expression of surprise, as though he couldn't believe what had happened.\n\n\"Helen, did you clean up post-game?\" Winston posed his question with a stern expression. The corner of his mouth upturned as he noticed a potential clue, but didn’t let it reach his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, Detective. As I always do,\" Helen replied, her face drawn with somberness. Winston noted her impeccably clean appearance and gloves, without a trace of mud despite the weather and her outdoor responsibilities.\n\nHelen was the housekeeper here. Mack, having no family, had entrusted her with the keys to the house, as mentioned in his will. Winston flipped through his notes, recalling that not only did Helen work for Mack, but she came to the game early that day and was still there after everyone had left, right around the time Mack was found dead.\n\nWinston delved a little deeper. \"I understand that you enjoy camping, Helen...alone?\" \n\n\"Yes, it's my chance to unwind, to hike off trails and be amongst nature. Besides, I enjoy the solitude that these trips offer and prefer not to have any company,\" Helen added, thereby hinting at why she refused to let anyone join her on these outings.\n\n\"I see,\" Winston said. \"And water activities, do you engage in any during these camping trips?\"\n\nTaken aback, Helen never expected such a question. \"Actually, no. I don't fancy spending time near the water, camping is mostly about the solitude for me.\"\n\n\"Hmm, I see.\" Winston made a show of jotting this down in his notebook, his eyes never leaving Helen's face.\n\n\"The people at the house, do they appreciate your work?\" Winston posed his question carefully.\n\n\"I’ve overheard malicious conversations about me and my work. It feels...almost humiliating, and objectifying. It hurt to know that the people I care for don’t return the sentiment,” Helen admitted, looking away.\n\nThe detective carefully observed Helen, making no judgments. As more pieces clicked into place, he thanked Helen and excused her, promising to update her further on the case. Winston prided himself on his professionalism. His job was simply to collect clues for an often unforgiving puzzle.\n\nHe couldn't shake the thought of why a housekeeper, like Helen, who strongly avoided mud and water, went camping so frequently, choosing often to go off the beaten trail. Equally intriguing was her insistence on not allowing others to accompany her on these trips. Hence, he moved on to collecting the next piece of the puzzle, all the while, carefully observing every action, every reaction, and every telltale indicator of deception. The game was still afoot, and Winston would leave no stone unturned.\n\nDetective Winston rubbed his temples, staring at the contents strewn from his bulging file. The victim's name was Mack. The young man had been on the cusp of marriage, though rumors swirled that the engagement was nothing more than an elaborate ruse to satisfy the expectations of his parents.\n\nWinston sighed deeply and continued to scan the case file. There was something unusual about this crime. The murder weapon of choice, a bottle of bleach, was anything but typical, and the name Danielle, scribbled repeatedly throughout his notes, gave the detective pause.\n\nDanielle - a local spiritual guru known throughout the community for her meticulous cleaning. Winston found it curious that someone who used cleanliness as a tool to attain spirituality would find herself mixed up in this grisly case. \n\nFrom what the detective had gathered, Danielle had been conducting one of her renowned spiritual sessions the day Mack was killed and with a chilling thought, Winston remembered that Mack could have been one of the attendees. After all, the soccer field where the young man's life was snuffed out was also Danielle's usual haunt for leading her sessions. In fact, she had the whole city at her fingertips, but she always chose the ever-bustling soccer field - a fact he couldn’t dismiss lightly.\n\nDanielle was a fervent believer in spiritual purity and she saw Mack's loveless marriage as a direct threat to that purity. That much was clear to Winston from copious notes and conversations he uncovered. He recalled one particular conversation recorded between Danielle and a friend where, talking about Mack, she had stated fervently, \"He needs to remain single. Marriage without love would be catastrophic to his spiritual purity\". \n\nChurch conversations known city-wide revealed Mack was ready to be shackled in a loveless marriage, a reality the entire city was privy to. This caught Winston's attention. He was certain Danielle was aware of Mack's arrangement, and it was playing into her concept of purity. This notion was definitely worth exploring.\n\nThe curious case of Danielle continued as Winston flicked through the file. Her obsessive cleaning ticked another in a list of oddities surrounding this spiritual guru. Bleach was her go-to choice, and she dedicated her spare time to scrubbing every surface she could reach, her way of achieving external and internal purity - or so she claimed. \n\nWinston shook his head as he closed the case file, a heavy sigh spewing from his lips. He had more questions now than when he'd started. Danielle’s belief system, her ubiquitous presence at the soccer field, Mack's loveless marriage, and Danielle's passion for cleaning - they all lay like jigsaw puzzle pieces yearning to be fit together.

I don't fancy spending time near the water, camping is mostly about the solitude for me.\"\n\n\"Hmm, I see.\" Winston made a show of jotting this down in his notebook, his eyes never leaving Helen's face.\n\n\"The people at the house, do they appreciate your work?\" Winston posed his question carefully.\n\n\"I’ve overheard malicious conversations about me and my work. It feels...almost humiliating, and objectifying. It hurt to know that the people I care for don’t return the sentiment,” Helen admitted, looking away.\n\nThe detective carefully observed Helen, making no judgments. As more pieces clicked into place, he thanked Helen and excused her, promising to update her further on the case. Winston prided himself on his professionalism. His job was simply to collect clues for an often unforgiving puzzle.\n\nHe couldn't shake the thought of why a housekeeper, like Helen, who strongly avoided mud and water, went camping so frequently, choosing often to go off the beaten trail. Equally intriguing was her insistence on not allowing others to accompany her on these trips. Hence, he moved on to collecting the next piece of the puzzle, all the while, carefully observing every action, every reaction, and every telltale indicator of deception. The game was still afoot, and Winston would leave no stone unturned.\n\nDetective Winston rubbed his temples, staring at the contents strewn from his bulging file. The victim's name was Mack. The young man had been on the cusp of marriage, though rumors swirled that the engagement was nothing more than an elaborate ruse to satisfy the expectations of his parents.\n\nWinston sighed deeply and continued to scan the case file. There was something unusual about this crime. The murder weapon of choice, a bottle of bleach, was anything but typical, and the name Danielle, scribbled repeatedly throughout his notes, gave the detective pause.\n\nDanielle - a local spiritual guru known throughout the community for her meticulous cleaning. Winston found it curious that someone who used cleanliness as a tool to attain spirituality would find herself mixed up in this grisly case. \n\nFrom what the detective had gathered, Danielle had been conducting one of her renowned spiritual sessions the day Mack was killed and with a chilling thought, Winston remembered that Mack could have been one of the attendees. After all, the soccer field where the young man's life was snuffed out was also Danielle's usual haunt for leading her sessions. In fact, she had the whole city at her fingertips, but she always chose the ever-bustling soccer field - a fact he couldn’t dismiss lightly.\n\nDanielle was a fervent believer in spiritual purity and she saw Mack's loveless marriage as a direct threat to that purity. That much was clear to Winston from copious notes and conversations he uncovered. He recalled one particular conversation recorded between Danielle and a friend where, talking about Mack, she had stated fervently, \"He needs to remain single. Marriage without love would be catastrophic to his spiritual purity\". \n\nChurch conversations known city-wide revealed Mack was ready to be shackled in a loveless marriage, a reality the entire city was privy to. This caught Winston's attention. He was certain Danielle was aware of Mack's arrangement, and it was playing into her concept of purity. This notion was definitely worth exploring.\n\nThe curious case of Danielle continued as Winston flicked through the file. Her obsessive cleaning ticked another in a list of oddities surrounding this spiritual guru. Bleach was her go-to choice, and she dedicated her spare time to scrubbing every surface she could reach, her way of achieving external and internal purity - or so she claimed. \n\nWinston shook his head as he closed the case file, a heavy sigh spewing from his lips. He had more questions now than when he'd started. Danielle’s belief system, her ubiquitous presence at the soccer field, Mack's loveless marriage, and Danielle's passion for cleaning - they all lay like jigsaw puzzle pieces yearning to be fit together. But how? The question remained unanswered as he rose from his seat, his thoughts lost in the intricate web of the case that lay before him.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the cramped confines of an airplane mid-flight, Zoe was slain using a simple bottle of bleach, propelling Detective Winston into a sky-high murder mystery involving two main suspects: Russell and Alice.\n\nDetective Winston traced his finger along the cleaning supply shelves on the upper deck of Russell's boat, eyeing the bleach conspicuously nestled between a bucket and a scrub brush. The boat bobbed upon the serene waves, while a plane passed overhead, reminding Winston of an earlier sighting.\n\nHe remembered seeing Russell boarding that particular plane; a coincidence which became crucial as the case developed.\n\n\"Russell,\" Winston began, involuntarily swaying a bit with the boat's movement, \"You use these for cleaning the vessel?\"\n\n\"Sure do. Learned that during my ship cleanup training. Bleach is requisite for keeping everything in shipshape,\" the sailor responded, stretching a calloused hand to pick up the vessel. \"However, I had a bit of an accident with it once, spilled it on my hands causing harsh chemical burns. Not pleasant, I can tell you.\"\n\nRussell's face hardened a bit as he set the bleach back in place, adding, somewhat awkwardly, \"But what can you do? Matter of training, innit? We all follow procedures.\"\n\nWinston nodded, making noncommittal noise in agreement. Then, he continued, \"Russell, tell me about that trip... the one you took not long ago.\"\n\n\"Oh, that?\" Russell scratched his head, \"Nothing much to tell, I don't fly often, water is more my domain. But yeah, had to visit family, got a ticket for a coastal ride.\"\n\nWinston leaned forward, observing Russell's expressions. \"By coincidence, Zoe was also on that flight, wasn't she?\" \n\nRussell stiffened slightly and Winston noticed the hint of worry crossing his eyes. \"Yeah, small world, innit? She was there, sat right beside me for the entirety of the trip.\"\n\nInquiring further Winston said, “Did she seem jittery to you, Russell? I Received word that she's been contacting the police for quite some time, reporting offenses she's witnessed.”\n\nRussell responded nervously, \"Yeah, heard something similar...It made me uncomfortable, seeing how she started discussing her crime witnessings and all... Well, she even talked about some smuggler group... and I involuntarily disclosed my involvement in questionable activities. Honestly, it felt as if she had seen right through me.”\n\nWinston noticed the worry in Russell's eyes again. He deduced it resulted from Zoe witnessing his wrongdoings and now disclosing these events to others, especially the police. Feeling the tension growing, Winston quickly shifted subjects, “There was even a time when she accepted a drink from you during the flight, didn’t she?”\n\nRussell looked at him, just a hint of surprise in his eyes as he affirmed, \"Yes. Yes, she did.\"\n\nAfter leaving Russell, Winston couldn't help but think of Zoe and the courage she had exhibited. Zoe had revealed to a close friend about Russell's suspicious actions that looked a lot like drug smuggling. As Winston walked away, he marveled at this young woman's knack for uncovering truths and wondered who’d believe that her penchant for justice would lead her down this turbulent path.\n\nWinston stood at the back of the airplane cabin, dull fluorescent lights casting an artificial pallor over the surrounding faces. There, in an almost eerie calm, sat Alice, the spiritual guru making her way to a retreat with Zoe. Alice was once a flight attendant and used to her guide her companions while flying, as can be seen by the way she carefully selected seats together while booking tickets for herself and Zoe for this flight. \n\n\"Alice,\" Winston began, taking the empty seat next to the spiritual guru. She turned to him, her face flushed and lined with sweat. He noted a fidgety disposition coupled with nervous scratching and almost indecipherable mumbling, but he continued. \"I heard you and Zoe were traveling together for a spiritual retreat. And, I remember a gossip at the airport that you specifically saw to it that your seats were together?\"\n\nAlice nodded, her hands shaking slightly. \"Yes, that's why we bought the tickets together. I always get nervous during flights. Being seated close to my companion helps.\" \n\nWinston took that in, feeling a certain satisfaction at the beads of sweat dotting Alice's forehead. \"And you were helping Zoe adjust with air travel like in your flight attendant days, right?\"\n\n\"No,\" Alice said rapidly, her hands touched her chest, and then flittering over the bottles laying around her. \"I... I just comfort her with my spiritual methods.\"\n\nThe detective's keen eyes took note of the bottles, their familiarity stinging his brain. Essential oil, but what interested Winston was the similarity they shared in shape and size with another bottle, a bleach bottle he remembered Alice once accidentally swallowed from in her past- the incident which maybe even led her towards understanding the spiritual practices involving bleach ingestion. \n\n\"You've got quite the collection of bottles here, Alice.\"\n\nShe nodded hesitatingly, \"For my spiritual practices. I was even researching the effects of bleach for cleansing... even after that incident where I accidentally swallowed a sip and had to go to the hospital. It got me interested, you see.\"\n\nWinston let her words trail off, but his mind was racing. He looked at Zoe's empty seat, her preferred Dragonfruit punch still untouched. The same beverage, Winston noticed, that was in Alice's bag, suspiciously close to the bleach-shaped bottles. \n\nBefore Winston got up to leave, he asked casually, \"Was it you who had an exchange with an infamous drug dealer some time back? I believe I saw you handing over some money.\"\n\nAlice's face turned whiter, if possible. \"That man... he had a history of selling illegal drugs... but I was only buying... I...\"\n\nWinston left her there, mumbling to herself. He had his facts. The mystery wasn't solved, but the clues were there, and Winston turned away as he received a message on his phone. He wondered if the truth went even deeper than it seemed.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Russell\nB.

Another murder, and this time - a shopping mall. Xenia, the victim, a blond woman in her early forties. Falling under the jurisdiction of his detective expertise, Winston gathered the scattered bits of facts and evidence that were available up to this point.\n\nThe murder weapon, a nail gun, an unusual choice. That fact alone put Winston’s investigation into a small percentage of the population who had access to such tools - contractors. And with this unfortunate coincidence was the fact that the nail gun used in the crime was reported missing from Wilfred's construction project, which made for even a more compelling lead to pursue. \n\nCourt sessions were known to be highly stressful, creating a complete sense of tension in the courtroom, causing lawyers like Wilfred to sweat profusely. Yet, even under such stressful circumstances Wilfred always maintained a fresh scent.\n\nUpon hearing this, his mind immediately turned to Wilfred, a local lawyer who was a known aficionado of construction, something that would give him easy access to nail guns. \n\nWinston sent out a request for surveillance footage of Wilfred's construction site, hoping to gain some insight into whether Wilfred had any interaction with nail guns. \n\nHe also requested the mall’s CCTV footage, given that Xenia was killed in the mall. The footage verified Wilfred’s presence in the mall around the same time Xenia was murdered. But that wasn't the evidence that caught Winston’s eye. It was the traces of bakery flour, always noticeable on Wilfred's shoes. \n\nWilfred was known to spend significant amounts of time on his feet in the courtroom, often sweating profusely due to the stressful court sessions. Yet a remarkable trait about Wilfred was that he maintained a fresh scent, even after a long day. This always intrigued Winston; however, upon further investigation, he discovered Wilfred's secret was the luxury of having a bathroom with a shower in his office; thus the puzzle started to come together.\n\nThe authorities were unsure of Wilfred's exact location during the murder. Nobody could verify his whereabouts and the time Xenia was killed, Wilfred was unaccounted for, posing a substantial mystery for Winston to solve.\n\nAs he continued his investigation, Winston implemented a strategic approach to obtain more information. He planned a meeting with Wilfred under the pretext of discussing a case, and at the scheduled meeting, he carefully observed the unassuming lawyer.\n\n\"When's the last time you visited your construction project, Wilfred?\" Winston asked, keeping a close eye on the man's reactions.\n\n\"Monday, as I recall,\" Wilfred responded, not missing a beat. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Just curiosity. You ever handle a nail gun before?\"\n\nWilfred offered a nonchalant shrug. \"Sure. Comes with the territory.\"\n\nWinston noted the answer, pressing further. \"And how about the mall? Been there recently?”\n\nWilfred nodded, stating, \"Oh, yes, a couple of times this week.\"\n\nIn the end, Winston came out of the meeting with more questions than answers, but the strings of information were beginning to shape a premise. One thing was certain - Wilfred was irrefutably intertwined in this case.\n\nWinston swept through the shopping mall like water, eyes scanning, earpiece transmitting information straight to the station. He was looking for Van, who had been on shift when Xenia was killed.\n\nHe spotted a muscular man with a nametag was unloading boxes from a service entrance, huffing and puffing as he went. \"Looks like our guy,\" he mumbled into his headset.\n\n\"I've been expecting you,\" said Van, the bodybuilder, wiping his sweat-drenched forehead with a well-charred sleeve. He pointed to a chair across the table, \"Have a seat, will you?\"\n\nWinston did, and before he even opened his mouth, Van was speaking, \"You know, Xenia was here almost every day. She loved this place, loved shopping. Sad thing what happened.\"\n\nWinston, not one for small talk, started grilling Van, \"You were on shift when she was killed, right Van?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I was,\" he replied. \"I ain't seen nothing though.\"\n\n\"What does your job entail?\"  Winston asked, changing the subject.\n\n\"I've got free run of this place. Lock, stock and barrel, I can move about as I please,” Van said, directing an intense look at Winston's face.  \n\n\"Your hobbies, Van?\" \n\n\"Used to build furniture for a living,\" He admitted, \"It was a bit of an obsession for a while. Even took a safety course from the local construction company.\"\n\n\"Did you now,\" Winston nodded, “Do you happen to own a nail gun?”\n\n“Bought one recently, yes,” Van said, as casually as if he were talking about the weather. “Receipt’s right here in my wallet.”\n\n\"Thanks for sharing.

It added up.\n\nBefore leaving, Winston couldn't help but casually ask, \"The insurance payout from her will, that a large sum?\"\n\n\"God-awful massive,\" Van answered after a moment of hesitation, \"And here I am buried under... well, a heap of bills, I'd rather not disclose.\"\n\nWith that, the detective left, collecting the pieces as he went.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Another murder, and this time - a shopping mall. Xenia, the victim, a blond woman in her early forties. Falling under the jurisdiction of his detective expertise, Winston gathered the scattered bits of facts and evidence that were available up to this point.\n\nThe murder weapon, a nail gun, an unusual choice. That fact alone put Winston’s investigation into a small percentage of the population who had access to such tools - contractors. And with this unfortunate coincidence was the fact that the nail gun used in the crime was reported missing from Wilfred's construction project, which made for even a more compelling lead to pursue. \n\nCourt sessions were known to be highly stressful, creating a complete sense of tension in the courtroom, causing lawyers like Wilfred to sweat profusely. Yet, even under such stressful circumstances Wilfred always maintained a fresh scent.\n\nUpon hearing this, his mind immediately turned to Wilfred, a local lawyer who was a known aficionado of construction, something that would give him easy access to nail guns. \n\nWinston sent out a request for surveillance footage of Wilfred's construction site, hoping to gain some insight into whether Wilfred had any interaction with nail guns. \n\nHe also requested the mall’s CCTV footage, given that Xenia was killed in the mall. The footage verified Wilfred’s presence in the mall around the same time Xenia was murdered. But that wasn't the evidence that caught Winston’s eye. It was the traces of bakery flour, always noticeable on Wilfred's shoes. \n\nWilfred was known to spend significant amounts of time on his feet in the courtroom, often sweating profusely due to the stressful court sessions.

Nobody could verify his whereabouts and the time Xenia was killed, Wilfred was unaccounted for, posing a substantial mystery for Winston to solve.\n\nAs he continued his investigation, Winston implemented a strategic approach to obtain more information. He planned a meeting with Wilfred under the pretext of discussing a case, and at the scheduled meeting, he carefully observed the unassuming lawyer.\n\n\"When's the last time you visited your construction project, Wilfred?\" Winston asked, keeping a close eye on the man's reactions.\n\n\"Monday, as I recall,\" Wilfred responded, not missing a beat. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Just curiosity. You ever handle a nail gun before?\"\n\nWilfred offered a nonchalant shrug. \"Sure. Comes with the territory.\"\n\nWinston noted the answer, pressing further. \"And how about the mall? Been there recently?”\n\nWilfred nodded, stating, \"Oh, yes, a couple of times this week.\"\n\nIn the end, Winston came out of the meeting with more questions than answers, but the strings of information were beginning to shape a premise. One thing was certain - Wilfred was irrefutably intertwined in this case.\n\nWinston swept through the shopping mall like water, eyes scanning, earpiece transmitting information straight to the station.

The field glistened beneath the afternoon sun as a reminder of what once was the playground of harmless games. Now an eerie reminder of Ana's demise.\n\nSurveying the area, Winston noticed a familiar figure in the distance, the outline of Troy, busy in conversation with a group of locals. Troy had a distinctive air about him, a missionary who traveled the globe. He seemed always ready to pack his bags and head off to the next mission. His relationships, both professional and personal, were as temporary as his mission assignments.\n\n\"Winston!\" Troy called out as he saw the detective approach. He quickly wound up his conversation, ending another flitting relationship, and moved to greet him.\n\n\"We meet again, Winston,\" said Troy. \n\n\"Yes, we do. You move around quite a bit, don't you, Troy?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"Will of the call, I suppose. As you know, the mission assignments don't last for very long. I come and go as the need arises. Just like tonight... I am eager to depart to my new destination.\"\n\nWinston nodded, \"Ana did hold quite a position in this community, didn't she?\"\n\nTroy squirmed a bit, \"Yes, she did hold the ultimate authority around here... and sometimes... it's rather... blocking,\" he disclosed rather uncomfortably.\n\n\"And you have been in war-torn areas as part of your mission work, haven't you?\" continued Winston. \n\n\"Yes. Yes, I have,\" Troy confessed, a shadow of uneasiness crossing over his face, \"I was asked to help deal with some... things,\" Troy paused and then added, \"like explosives.\"\n\nWinston continued to stare at him while he spoke, his words sounding like a confession. Still, he remembered the black market weapons site Troy was spotted browsing. \"Quite a history you have, Troy. From relationships to missions, everything has a short lifespan it seems.\"\n\n\"But surely, you must understand, Winston. My journey is driven by divine visions... dreams... prophetic even,\" Troy countered. \"It's these visions...they've shown me that I’m destined to ascend in the rank, to a position like Ana's.\"\n\nWinston blinked, taken aback. \"You think you deserve Ana's position?\"\n\nTroy nodded confessing, \"Maybe it's audacious of me, but yes, I believe I do.\"\n\nAs Winston got into his car later that night, Troy's words about deserving Ana's position kept ringing in his ears. He grimaced and put the car in drive. It was going to be a long night.\n\nThe day was hot, blistering under the late summer sun. The ominous field, notorious for being not only the town's beloved paintball venue but also the crime scene where Ana had been found, buzzed with the adrenaline-infused excitement of an ongoing paintball match. The air smelled of both fresh earth and the grim history of the location. Detective Winston stood at the edge of the blood-stained playfield, studying the dynamics of the game, where both Bethany and the ill-fated Ana had registered to play.\n\nA young woman with windblown hair and a look of absolute determination on her face charged across the field, a steady rain of paintballs exploding around her. Her name was Bethany, Ana's best friend, and unbeknownst to many, her unrequited lover. Winston had read all about her in the case files.\n\nAs the game ended and the players congregated to chat and catch their breath, Winston approached Bethany. Her eyes were still bright with the adrenaline of the game, but they dimmed slightly when she saw him. \n\n\"Howdy, Miss. I'm Detective Winston. Can I talk with you for a moment?\"\n\nBethany nodded but there was hesitance in it. They retreated from the laughter and the noise, heading towards a grove of trees bordering the field. Once they were far enough to be out of earshot, Bethany rounded on him.\n\n\"You're here about Ana, aren't you?\"\n\nIn her voice, Winston heard the threads of grief, but underneath it all was a tangible hint of obsession. According to her friends, talking about Ana was Bethany's habitual way of coping. Bethany's story was compelling, from her military background to her serving duties at the local base, known for its hefty supply of grenades - a dangerous knowledge she was specifically trained for.\n\n\"Yes, about Ana... It must have been hard for you. I heard you two were close.\" \n\nBethany's face scrunched at that. \"Close? Ana was... she was everything to me. I told her as much. But she... she just saw me as a friend.\" She added the last bit in so softly, Winston had to incline his head to hear.\n\nTrying to divert from the topic, he commented. \"That was a good game you played back there. You and Ana... same team I presume?\"\n\n\"You could say that,\" she replied grinning. \"All of us were here, in the very same game, believing that it's just another fun day. Though Ana was always the one who wanted to win. I even followed her around everywhere to learn how she played.\"\n\nWinston glanced at his watch. The time of the paintball game coincided with the exact time when Ana was found. A chilling coincidence he couldn't ignore.\n\n\"Well, thank you for your time, Bethany. I hope we can chat again soon.\"\n\nAs he turned to leave, Bethany called out one last thing.\n\n\"Detective Winston? We all loved Ana... Some of us more than others.\"\n\nAs Winston walked towards his car, his mind replayed those words over and over again.

Now an eerie reminder of Ana's demise.\n\nSurveying the area, Winston noticed a familiar figure in the distance, the outline of Troy, busy in conversation with a group of locals. Troy had a distinctive air about him, a missionary who traveled the globe. He seemed always ready to pack his bags and head off to the next mission. His relationships, both professional and personal, were as temporary as his mission assignments.\n\n\"Winston!\" Troy called out as he saw the detective approach. He quickly wound up his conversation, ending another flitting relationship, and moved to greet him.\n\n\"We meet again, Winston,\" said Troy. \n\n\"Yes, we do. You move around quite a bit, don't you, Troy?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"Will of the call, I suppose. As you know, the mission assignments don't last for very long. I come and go as the need arises. Just like tonight... I am eager to depart to my new destination.\"\n\nWinston nodded, \"Ana did hold quite a position in this community, didn't she?\"\n\nTroy squirmed a bit, \"Yes, she did hold the ultimate authority around here... and sometimes... it's rather... blocking,\" he disclosed rather uncomfortably.\n\n\"And you have been in war-torn areas as part of your mission work, haven't you?\" continued Winston. \n\n\"Yes. Yes, I have,\" Troy confessed, a shadow of uneasiness crossing over his face, \"I was asked to help deal with some... things,\" Troy paused and then added, \"like explosives.\"\n\nWinston continued to stare at him while he spoke, his words sounding like a confession. Still, he remembered the black market weapons site Troy was spotted browsing. \"Quite a history you have, Troy. From relationships to missions, everything has a short lifespan it seems.\"\n\n\"But surely, you must understand, Winston. My journey is driven by divine visions... dreams... prophetic even,\" Troy countered. \"It's these visions...they've shown me that I’m destined to ascend in the rank, to a position like Ana's.\"\n\nWinston blinked, taken aback. \"You think you deserve Ana's position?\"\n\nTroy nodded confessing, \"Maybe it's audacious of me, but yes, I believe I do.\"\n\nAs Winston got into his car later that night, Troy's words about deserving Ana's position kept ringing in his ears. He grimaced and put the car in drive. It was going to be a long night.\n\nThe day was hot, blistering under the late summer sun. The ominous field, notorious for being not only the town's beloved paintball venue but also the crime scene where Ana had been found, buzzed with the adrenaline-infused excitement of an ongoing paintball match. The air smelled of both fresh earth and the grim history of the location. Detective Winston stood at the edge of the blood-stained playfield, studying the dynamics of the game, where both Bethany and the ill-fated Ana had registered to play.\n\nA young woman with windblown hair and a look of absolute determination on her face charged across the field, a steady rain of paintballs exploding around her. Her name was Bethany, Ana's best friend, and unbeknownst to many, her unrequited lover. Winston had read all about her in the case files.\n\nAs the game ended and the players congregated to chat and catch their breath, Winston approached Bethany. Her eyes were still bright with the adrenaline of the game, but they dimmed slightly when she saw him. \n\n\"Howdy, Miss. I'm Detective Winston. Can I talk with you for a moment?\"\n\nBethany nodded but there was hesitance in it. They retreated from the laughter and the noise, heading towards a grove of trees bordering the field. Once they were far enough to be out of earshot, Bethany rounded on him.\n\n\"You're here about Ana, aren't you?\"\n\nIn her voice, Winston heard the threads of grief, but underneath it all was a tangible hint of obsession. According to her friends, talking about Ana was Bethany's habitual way of coping. Bethany's story was compelling, from her military background to her serving duties at the local base, known for its hefty supply of grenades - a dangerous knowledge she was specifically trained for.\n\n\"Yes, about Ana... It must have been hard for you. I heard you two were close.\" \n\nBethany's face scrunched at that. \"Close? Ana was... she was everything to me. I told her as much. But she... she just saw me as a friend.\" She added the last bit in so softly, Winston had to incline his head to hear.\n\nTrying to divert from the topic, he commented. \"That was a good game you played back there. You and Ana... same team I presume?\"\n\n\"You could say that,\" she replied grinning. \"All of us were here, in the very same game, believing that it's just another fun day. Though Ana was always the one who wanted to win. I even followed her around everywhere to learn how she played.\"\n\nWinston glanced at his watch. The time of the paintball game coincided with the exact time when Ana was found. A chilling coincidence he couldn't ignore.\n\n\"Well, thank you for your time, Bethany. I hope we can chat again soon.\"\n\nAs he turned to leave, Bethany called out one last thing.\n\n\"Detective Winston? We all loved Ana...

It was a terrible scene involving a grenade explosion, a midnight movie, and a tragedy. Winston ran a hand over his tired face as he recollected the events of the night. The victim, Chloe, had invited Ruby, a local psychic with a unique talent of foreseeing dangerous situations in her visions, to the movies. In the past, these visions had often involved violent scenes where weapons like grenades were used, a dangerous gift she suspected was influenced by her military background.\n\nThey'd stayed until the late night showing ended, and witnesses mentioned they were the last to leave. They also confirmed that none other individuals were seen entering or exiting the theater. \n\nWinston made his way to the torn-up cinema, stooping to look at the grenaded remains.

He suppressed a shudder as he thought about the fatalities she might have presaged in her past, with the shadow of a grenade always lingering in her visions, all too accurate.\n\nIn situations like these, she could have known how to handle a grenade, her service in the military would have ensured that. He had heard about this psychic's history. Ruby's accuracy was unsettling... Her record of predicting family tragedies had created an odd mix of fear and respect amongst her kin. They were a superstitious lot, some even believed that her visions were causing the very catastrophes she prophesied.\n\nWinston beckoned an officer over, borrowing his notepad and pen to jot down some reminders. Ruby was last seen with Chloe. Ruby went to her brother’s house after the movie - The brother, who also happens to be an arms dealer.\n\nWinston made his way to Ruby's apartment for an interview. Ruby had a feral look about her - her argument with her mother had clearly shaken her. She had decided to break off contact with her family after that blowout. Both of them seemed to be quite stubborn.\n\n\"Ruby,\" Winston began, \"Can you tell me about the last time you saw Chloe?\" He asked, his steely gaze fixing on her. \n\n\"Yes, Detective. We watched a movie together. It ran late, we both stayed until the end.\" Ruby replied.\n\n\"And after the movie?\" Winston probed.\n\n\"I... I went to visit my brother. He sells... various products.

What a way to spend his Sunday, pouring over case files and suspect lists. He moved onto the next file on his desk: Roscoe, an astrophysicist by day, apparent drug addict by night. \n\nHis astrophysics job had Roscoe planted in a military base, which was known to have an arsenal that included grenades, for research purposes. Here, he utilized his broad scientific background including physics and chemistry. Although he normally processed information in a meticulous and scientific manner, witness testimonies painted a different picture altogether. Apparently, Roscoe had been acting erratically lately. Having a quick look at his employee records, Winston saw a slew of complaints piled up within the last few weeks. \n\nRoscoe's troubles found their way outside of the workplace, into a small apartment where he was the tenant. When the police were called for a noise complaint, they found drug paraphernalia scattered across the living room. Surely, his military career would see its last days if word got out. \n\nWinston sighed, leaning back in his chair, skimming through his notes. He paused at the mention of a late-night movie. Chloe, the unfortunate victim, had been Roscoe's unsuspecting companion in the dark theater. Just as the opening credits rolled, her life had been cut short by a grenade. \n\nWitness statements gathered at the scene confirmed that Roscoe had purchased a ticket for the same movie screening just moments before it began. Someone had seen him enter the theater, seemingly in a hurry. \n\n\"These cases just keep getting trickier,\" Winston muttered to himself, downing another cup of coffee. His eyes moved to another statement, this time by one of Chloe's friends. It seemed that Chloe was about to report Roscoe's drug addiction to his superiors.\n\nWinston called Roscoe's workplace. \"Is that Roscoe's current position?\" he asked the person on the other end. \"Have you noticed anything... odd about his behavior lately?\" He listened carefully to the responses, his face impassive.\n\n\"No further questions,\" Winston said as he bid goodbye and hung up the office phone.

He moved onto the next file on his desk: Roscoe, an astrophysicist by day, apparent drug addict by night. \n\nHis astrophysics job had Roscoe planted in a military base, which was known to have an arsenal that included grenades, for research purposes. Here, he utilized his broad scientific background including physics and chemistry. Although he normally processed information in a meticulous and scientific manner, witness testimonies painted a different picture altogether. Apparently, Roscoe had been acting erratically lately. Having a quick look at his employee records, Winston saw a slew of complaints piled up within the last few weeks. \n\nRoscoe's troubles found their way outside of the workplace, into a small apartment where he was the tenant. When the police were called for a noise complaint, they found drug paraphernalia scattered across the living room. Surely, his military career would see its last days if word got out. \n\nWinston sighed, leaning back in his chair, skimming through his notes. He paused at the mention of a late-night movie. Chloe, the unfortunate victim, had been Roscoe's unsuspecting companion in the dark theater. Just as the opening credits rolled, her life had been cut short by a grenade. \n\nWitness statements gathered at the scene confirmed that Roscoe had purchased a ticket for the same movie screening just moments before it began. Someone had seen him enter the theater, seemingly in a hurry. \n\n\"These cases just keep getting trickier,\" Winston muttered to himself, downing another cup of coffee. His eyes moved to another statement, this time by one of Chloe's friends. It seemed that Chloe was about to report Roscoe's drug addiction to his superiors.\n\nWinston called Roscoe's workplace. \"Is that Roscoe's current position?\" he asked the person on the other end. \"Have you noticed anything... odd about his behavior lately?\" He listened carefully to the responses, his face impassive.\n\n\"No further questions,\" Winston said as he bid goodbye and hung up the office phone.

It was a terrible scene involving a grenade explosion, a midnight movie, and a tragedy. Winston ran a hand over his tired face as he recollected the events of the night. The victim, Chloe, had invited Ruby, a local psychic with a unique talent of foreseeing dangerous situations in her visions, to the movies. In the past, these visions had often involved violent scenes where weapons like grenades were used, a dangerous gift she suspected was influenced by her military background.\n\nThey'd stayed until the late night showing ended, and witnesses mentioned they were the last to leave. They also confirmed that none other individuals were seen entering or exiting the theater. \n\nWinston made his way to the torn-up cinema, stooping to look at the grenaded remains. The air was still heavy with the acrid residue of the explosion. Ruby, the psychic. Ruby, the military veteran. He suppressed a shudder as he thought about the fatalities she might have presaged in her past, with the shadow of a grenade always lingering in her visions, all too accurate.\n\nIn situations like these, she could have known how to handle a grenade, her service in the military would have ensured that. He had heard about this psychic's history. Ruby's accuracy was unsettling... Her record of predicting family tragedies had created an odd mix of fear and respect amongst her kin. They were a superstitious lot, some even believed that her visions were causing the very catastrophes she prophesied.\n\nWinston beckoned an officer over, borrowing his notepad and pen to jot down some reminders. Ruby was last seen with Chloe. Ruby went to her brother’s house after the movie - The brother, who also happens to be an arms dealer.\n\nWinston made his way to Ruby's apartment for an interview. Ruby had a feral look about her - her argument with her mother had clearly shaken her. She had decided to break off contact with her family after that blowout. Both of them seemed to be quite stubborn.\n\n\"Ruby,\" Winston began, \"Can you tell me about the last time you saw Chloe?\" He asked, his steely gaze fixing on her. \n\n\"Yes, Detective. We watched a movie together. It ran late, we both stayed until the end.\" Ruby replied.\n\n\"And after the movie?\" Winston probed.\n\n\"I... I went to visit my brother. He sells... various products.

Iris' case was looking to be anything but simple. The security footage he was able to secure put Christine right at ground zero; casino floor, the same night Iris' winning streak took a deadly turn. \n\nHe slid into his car, the sound of traffic dulled as his mind replayed the chilling footage. Christine and Iris, always cooperating so well on their work projects, appeared just as comfortable sharing space in the casino that night.\n\nSliding the photographs into the evidence bag, Winston started the car. His first destination for the day; Christine's construction site.\n\nThe sound of heavy machinery, power tools and manual labor filled the air as Winston approached the site. Gazing around the active scene with a professional eye, he watched Christine effortlessly hoist cement bags onto a forklift. Her muscles rippled from the demanding physical labor of her job, a testament to her dedication.\n\n\"Christine,\" Winston called, catching her attention, \"mind sparing a moment?\"\n\nChristine nonchalantly wiped sweat from her brow and nodded, making her way over to him. \n\n\"Working hard or hardly working?\" Winston couldn't resist, despite the grave context of their conversation. Christine managed to roll her eyes and chuckle.\n\n\"I swear, with jobs like these, most men don't even last a day,\" she casually put. \"It's a wonder how they're even lasting in relationships. Even people like Peter, Mark, Luke, John, and Matthew couldn't keep up with me. One month in and they all complained I lost interest.\"\n\nWinston took note, a smile creeping onto his lips, \"You've been quite active, Christine. Managed to juggle five relationships and it's just May.\"\n\nChristine smirked, \"Well, a lady needs some excitement, doesn't she?\"\n\nWinston shook his head in amusement, \"Let's bring it back to business, Christine.\"\n\nTheir banter aside, Winston's mind was fully trained on the bitter truth - Iris' regular winning streak at the casino, compared to the lead pipe from the construction site, implied a deadly connection. Several pieces of the puzzle were falling into place, but he would need more to make his case.\n\nHe said his goodbyes, leaving behind the clamor of the construction site. His day was far from over. There were still questions to be asked, clues to be found, and a murderer to catch. The drive to his next destination would give him the chance to mull over what he'd so far uncovered. The tip of the iceberg, probably, but his determined spirit wouldn't allow him to rest until justice was served.\n\nWinston was looking over the contents of his coffee cup when he got the call. Iris, a court case witness, had been murdered. The siren of the crime scene was loud and constant, perhaps a metaphor for the nature of the case which was shaping up to be complex and chaotic. \n\nSquinting under the neon lights of the casino, Winston looked for his suspect, Madison. The lady in question always wore a hard hat and was often seen by him around the building, repairing things. She was surrounded by a tool-laden van so often that a casual observer might mistake her for the groundskeeper. She had her roles in the building, fixing things here and there, seemingly always mending mistakes.\n\nHer worn-out van had become a makeshift storage space for building equipment. Winston couldn't help but notice the glow from a lead pipe resting within the remaining pile. The pipe surreptitiously nestled between hammer and screwdriver.\n\nIris' testimony, scheduled to be presented at the court soon, had been against Madison's illegal shenanigans. Layers of intrigue were folded over the delicate connection: the lawyer had informed Madison about her upcoming ordeal. Such update from Madison's lawyer would often coincide with the time she saw Iris leaving for her customary Friday night casino visits. The irony of it burnt brighter than the burgeoning dawn.\n\nFollowing a trail of circumstantial evidence, Winston discovered that Madison had been threatened with eviction due to her illicit affairs. The threat had surely hanged like a smog around her, dark and ominous.\n\n“What a twisted mess!” Winston thought as he rubbed shivering hands over weary eyes. Frequent visits to the casino by Iris could be seen as just a pastime or, to a mind uncertain of the future, as potential avenues for threat mitigation. Madison's observations of Iris's Friday night gambles could be a coincidence... or a clear implication of premeditation.\n\nCasino surveillance tapes confirmed the regular presence. Madison and Iris, both regular features under the glaring camera lights. The unblinking eye of the casino camera had captured Madison's presence around the vicinity even as the clock chimed Iris's hour of departure from the world.\n\nWinston found himself standing before the courthouse doors, a paper with fresh ink in his hands. Iris had been there, holding the very same documents, their legality meant to condemn Madison in a court of law. \n\nCasual yet conspicuous, Madison had been seen overhearing the constant chatter of Iris about her late-night casino visits. Her lawyer's advice combined with the threat of eviction added fuel to the tension... Winston sighed deeply as he shielded the court documents from the continual rain.\n\nPiecing together the jigsaw puzzle seemed daunting.

Several pieces of the puzzle were falling into place, but he would need more to make his case.\n\nHe said his goodbyes, leaving behind the clamor of the construction site. His day was far from over. There were still questions to be asked, clues to be found, and a murderer to catch. The drive to his next destination would give him the chance to mull over what he'd so far uncovered. The tip of the iceberg, probably, but his determined spirit wouldn't allow him to rest until justice was served.\n\nWinston was looking over the contents of his coffee cup when he got the call. Iris, a court case witness, had been murdered. The siren of the crime scene was loud and constant, perhaps a metaphor for the nature of the case which was shaping up to be complex and chaotic. \n\nSquinting under the neon lights of the casino, Winston looked for his suspect, Madison. The lady in question always wore a hard hat and was often seen by him around the building, repairing things. She was surrounded by a tool-laden van so often that a casual observer might mistake her for the groundskeeper. She had her roles in the building, fixing things here and there, seemingly always mending mistakes.\n\nHer worn-out van had become a makeshift storage space for building equipment. Winston couldn't help but notice the glow from a lead pipe resting within the remaining pile. The pipe surreptitiously nestled between hammer and screwdriver.\n\nIris' testimony, scheduled to be presented at the court soon, had been against Madison's illegal shenanigans. Layers of intrigue were folded over the delicate connection: the lawyer had informed Madison about her upcoming ordeal. Such update from Madison's lawyer would often coincide with the time she saw Iris leaving for her customary Friday night casino visits. The irony of it burnt brighter than the burgeoning dawn.\n\nFollowing a trail of circumstantial evidence, Winston discovered that Madison had been threatened with eviction due to her illicit affairs. The threat had surely hanged like a smog around her, dark and ominous.\n\n“What a twisted mess!” Winston thought as he rubbed shivering hands over weary eyes. Frequent visits to the casino by Iris could be seen as just a pastime or, to a mind uncertain of the future, as potential avenues for threat mitigation. Madison's observations of Iris's Friday night gambles could be a coincidence... or a clear implication of premeditation.\n\nCasino surveillance tapes confirmed the regular presence. Madison and Iris, both regular features under the glaring camera lights. The unblinking eye of the casino camera had captured Madison's presence around the vicinity even as the clock chimed Iris's hour of departure from the world.\n\nWinston found himself standing before the courthouse doors, a paper with fresh ink in his hands. Iris had been there, holding the very same documents, their legality meant to condemn Madison in a court of law. \n\nCasual yet conspicuous, Madison had been seen overhearing the constant chatter of Iris about her late-night casino visits. Her lawyer's advice combined with the threat of eviction added fuel to the tension... Winston sighed deeply as he shielded the court documents from the continual rain.\n\nPiecing together the jigsaw puzzle seemed daunting. Again, his thoughts revolved around Madison under her hard hat. His next steps unraveling her story had all begun with Iris' murder.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the cramped confines of an airplane mid-flight, Zoe was slain using a simple bottle of bleach, propelling Detective Winston into a sky-high murder mystery involving two main suspects: Russell and Alice.\n\nAs detective Winston stared at the boarded up airplane on the tarmac, his mind churned over the limited evidence he had at his disposal. Zoe, the cheerful flight stewardess was the victim, and he was about to interview one of the contentious suspects - a sailor by trade, a man named Russell. Detective Winston had seen him earlier that day. He was watching from a distance as Russell, with animal carcasses in tow, disappeared into his home. Winston didn't believe he had ever come across a more unique assortment of characters in any of his previous investigations. He sighed and decided it was time to meet with Russell, his main course of inquiry for the day.\n\nMaking his way to the docking area in the early morning light, he spotted a weathered sailor hunching over a bucket filled with cleaning supplies on his trawler. Bleach was prominent among them, a bottle of it sitting half used on the washed deck. As Winston approached, Russell began to explain how he had unintentionally injured himself in the past while cleaning his boat with the very same bleach. Despite the painful memory, it seemed he was determined to keep his ship sparking and sanitary as per his sailor training.\n\nDuring their conversation, Russell mentioned his aesthetics and love for taxidermy, a skill he had picked up during one of his various trips abroad, in particular, a trip to Norway. He explained how he always tried to learn something new from every country he visited, and Norway taught him taxidermy. \"And then there's my taxidermy workshop at home, in the basement,\" Russell revealed, \"...probably filled with dust bunnies now.\" He even told Winston about several animal carcasses he planned to work with later that evening in his basement workshop.\n\nFeeling he had gained his trust, Winston eased into the events which transpired in the airplane, \"You boarded the flight with Zoe, correct?\" Russell nodded, wrinkling his already weather-worn face. He began to retell his version of events. Winston noted that Russell started with how he found himself sitting next to Zoe on the airplane, further deepening their connection. From shared cab glasses to a friendly conversation which culminated in Russell offering Zoe a drink during the flight, the events were building up to an intricate narrative. Winston stored away these significant details which included their seating arrangement on the flight, to review later.\n\nAs the day wore on, Winston decided to wrap up his inquiry. Confirming with Russell his ticket receipt and presence on the same flight with Zoe, he felt he was making progress. An observing officer had provided his statement of seeing Russell board the same plane as Zoe. This was slowly shaping up into a complex murder mystery involving a sailor, bleach, taxidermy, and air travel. Winston ended his day at a local bar, quietly replaying the events of the day, piecing together this unique puzzle to get closer to the truth.\n\nThe piercing glare of Detective Winston enveloped the flamboyant spiritual guru Alice, as she walked towards him under the high terminal ceilings of the airport. Clad in flowing robes with bottles of various shapes and sizes dangling from her belt, she confidently greeted him. \n\n\"Detective Winston, I was expecting you. After all, one doesn't have to be a spiritual guru to know that after what happened, the police would want answers.\"\n\nWinston viewed her flamboyant getup briefly and caught sight of the wide variety of bottles she lugged around. Among them were the weirdly familiar-looking bleach bottles.\n\nAlice's past as a flight attendant was no secret. Through that career, she also formed a close bond with Zoe. They recently boarded a plane together in order to attend a spiritual retreat. Alice had been meticulous in arranging the journey, purchasing tickets specifically for seats next to each other.\n\nSundrenched in conversation, one fact kept flashing in Winston's mind. Zoe had found documents against Alice; a heap of paperwork that cast these spiritual practices in a harsh and fraudulent light. One crucial point Alice admitted to was being present when Zoe discovered these damning papers. \n\nA gentle rustling of papers revealed that Alice had also seen Zoe making copies of these records. In the ambiguous silence, Alice poured herself a drink from one of her many bottles. She couldn't help but mention Zoe's preference for the same beverage that she carried in the same bag where the bleach-like bottles sat nestled.\n\n\"I accidentally sipped bleach once,\" Alice suddenly offered up, piling pressure on the unsaid words looming between them. \"The hospital visit wasn't pleasant.\" \n\nThe detective's eyes shifted from Alice to her hands. The bottles she was carrying flaunts similar size and shape to that of a bleach bottle. \n\n\"There is this spiritual cleansing practice,\" Alice continued, \"It involves the ingestion of bleach. Out of curiosity, I researched its effects. Nothing serious, just trying to learn more about it.\"\n\nWinston nodded, carefully treading around the probing questions he wanted to ask, knowing this was not the time to draw any conclusions.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the cramped confines of an airplane mid-flight, Zoe was slain using a simple bottle of bleach, propelling Detective Winston into a sky-high murder mystery involving two main suspects: Russell and Alice.\n\nAs detective Winston stared at the boarded up airplane on the tarmac, his mind churned over the limited evidence he had at his disposal. Zoe, the cheerful flight stewardess was the victim, and he was about to interview one of the contentious suspects - a sailor by trade, a man named Russell. Detective Winston had seen him earlier that day. He was watching from a distance as Russell, with animal carcasses in tow, disappeared into his home. Winston didn't believe he had ever come across a more unique assortment of characters in any of his previous investigations. He sighed and decided it was time to meet with Russell, his main course of inquiry for the day.\n\nMaking his way to the docking area in the early morning light, he spotted a weathered sailor hunching over a bucket filled with cleaning supplies on his trawler. Bleach was prominent among them, a bottle of it sitting half used on the washed deck. As Winston approached, Russell began to explain how he had unintentionally injured himself in the past while cleaning his boat with the very same bleach. Despite the painful memory, it seemed he was determined to keep his ship sparking and sanitary as per his sailor training.\n\nDuring their conversation, Russell mentioned his aesthetics and love for taxidermy, a skill he had picked up during one of his various trips abroad, in particular, a trip to Norway. He explained how he always tried to learn something new from every country he visited, and Norway taught him taxidermy. \"And then there's my taxidermy workshop at home, in the basement,\" Russell revealed, \"...probably filled with dust bunnies now.\" He even told Winston about several animal carcasses he planned to work with later that evening in his basement workshop.\n\nFeeling he had gained his trust, Winston eased into the events which transpired in the airplane, \"You boarded the flight with Zoe, correct?\" Russell nodded, wrinkling his already weather-worn face. He began to retell his version of events. Winston noted that Russell started with how he found himself sitting next to Zoe on the airplane, further deepening their connection. From shared cab glasses to a friendly conversation which culminated in Russell offering Zoe a drink during the flight, the events were building up to an intricate narrative. Winston stored away these significant details which included their seating arrangement on the flight, to review later.\n\nAs the day wore on, Winston decided to wrap up his inquiry. Confirming with Russell his ticket receipt and presence on the same flight with Zoe, he felt he was making progress. An observing officer had provided his statement of seeing Russell board the same plane as Zoe. This was slowly shaping up into a complex murder mystery involving a sailor, bleach, taxidermy, and air travel. Winston ended his day at a local bar, quietly replaying the events of the day, piecing together this unique puzzle to get closer to the truth.\n\nThe piercing glare of Detective Winston enveloped the flamboyant spiritual guru Alice, as she walked towards him under the high terminal ceilings of the airport. Clad in flowing robes with bottles of various shapes and sizes dangling from her belt, she confidently greeted him. \n\n\"Detective Winston, I was expecting you. After all, one doesn't have to be a spiritual guru to know that after what happened, the police would want answers.\"\n\nWinston viewed her flamboyant getup briefly and caught sight of the wide variety of bottles she lugged around. Among them were the weirdly familiar-looking bleach bottles.\n\nAlice's past as a flight attendant was no secret. Through that career, she also formed a close bond with Zoe. They recently boarded a plane together in order to attend a spiritual retreat. Alice had been meticulous in arranging the journey, purchasing tickets specifically for seats next to each other.\n\nSundrenched in conversation, one fact kept flashing in Winston's mind. Zoe had found documents against Alice; a heap of paperwork that cast these spiritual practices in a harsh and fraudulent light. One crucial point Alice admitted to was being present when Zoe discovered these damning papers. \n\nA gentle rustling of papers revealed that Alice had also seen Zoe making copies of these records. In the ambiguous silence, Alice poured herself a drink from one of her many bottles.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the eerie silence of the swamp, Jess was brutally murdered with a sai, leaving Detective Winston sorting through a mire of secrets and lies involving two prime suspects - Leona and Freya.\n\nThe muggy air of the swamp, with its accompanying sounds of buzzing insects and distant croaks of frogs, was a strange backdrop to a brutal crime. Winston's face took on a grim expression as he squinted his eyes against the setting sun, trying to piece together the final gruesome moments of Jess. Found dead near the swamp, the victim's pale hand still clutched a crumpled VIP pass to the recent concert. The singer, Leona, was the main attraction.\n\nDeep in thought, Winston absentmindedly thumbed the murder weapon, a well-crafted sai. The sai was brand new, still wearing the faint scent of the store – it was witty of Leona to buy it so recently... Leona's sai... that was found at the scene. With this new piece of information, he decided to pay the singer a visit during her late-night martial arts class.\n\nEntering the practice room, Winston noticed Leona in the middle of an intense sparring session. Her instructor watched with clear admiration as she dodged blows, her expression intense and focused. She slid into stroke, parrying with a level of expertise that implied countless hours of training. The instructor had remarked on her swift improvement with the sa, speculating on the freshness of her acquisition.\n\nAfter the session, catching her breath with graceful composure, Leona crossed the floor to speak with Winston. As they talked, a subtle shift towards true crime came over their conversation. The sparkle in Leona's eye contrasted against the seriousness of the subject matter. It was clear she was comfortable, almost enthusiastic, addressing crime scenarios, drawing similarities to real events in the documentaries she frequently watched and wrote about. \n\nAs they walked through the venue, Winston observed Leona's possessions, pausing over what appeared to be a well-worn notebook filled with notes upon notes on various crime documentaries. Intriguingly, Winston remembered another reference to this notebook from an event-goer at a recent documentary screening he had attended. He had seen the same notebook in Leona’s hand as she bought her new sai and scribbled away fervently while the documentary ran. \n\nWinston remarked on the close proximity of the concert venue – only a stone’s throw away from the swamp. Leona explained the choice, explaining how she loved the allure of the swamp during night, something atmospheric and eerie about the location that added a unique edge to her concerts... \n\n\"She headed towards the swamp... after the concert, going towards the place she loved.\" The innocent statement caught Winston by surprise. He had stumbled upon someone who had noticed Jess, after Leona's performance, walk blissfully towards the swamp, clutching her VIP pass – the scene of her untimely death.\n\nAs Detective Winston thanked Leona for her time, he looked back at the singer, her recently purchased sai cradled in her forearm skillfully as if it were an extension of her own body. Winston couldn't quite shake off the strange sensation that washed over him. Returning to the stillness of his own vehicle, not yet ready to move on, he just sat there under the starlight, trying to make sense of the eerie dance between the facts that were slowly crafting the narrative to this murder. The story had many more veiled layers waiting to be discovered — and some heavy curtains waiting to be lifted.\n\nWinston found himself standing in Freya's living room, his eyes quickly falling on a display case filled with various medieval weapons including the peculiar missing spot of a sai. Freya positioned herself beside Winston, noting his interest in her unique collection, \"Those ais hold a special place in my heart. A reminder of my martial arts training back in the day. Even last week, I was at the dojo practicing with my favorite, a sai.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston hummed, a non-committal sound as he mentally filed away the information. He peered at the open spot in the case shaping a sai- the exact style like the weapon found in Jess and seemingly missing from the collection. He remembered the local authorities report about a matching weapon disappearing recently. \n\nShifting his focus back on Freya, Winston decided to delve deeper. \"And you frequent the local dojo, am I correct?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" Freya piped, curious. \"I was there just last week.\"\n\n\"And Jess,\" Winston moved on. \"You seem to have spent quite a sum to gain some insight on her.\"\n\nFlustered, Freya breathed heavily, \"Yes, I hired a private investigator. Jess started playing games, bragging about dirt she claimed to have on me.\"\n\n\"How does bird-watching tie into these games?\" Winston questioned, casually dropping a seemingly unrelated question.\n\nTaken aback, Freya chuckled awkwardly, \"Well detective, I do frequent the swamp near here to observe the local birdlife. And yes, my car was indeed spotted parked there recently.\"\n\nSeizing the moment, Winston probed, \"So you would be quite familiar with navigating the swamplands then?\" \n\nFreya gritted her teeth, \"Yes, Detective. As I said, I often go there. My father taught me how to navigate those swamps.\"\n\nNext he opened his folder, producing the letter meant for the local paper, written by Jess. Winston watched as Freya's reactions shifted from surprise to anger, to a controlled calm. It spoke volumes more than her carefully composed words, \"Jess threw accusations left and right, yes. I asked our mutual friends to intervene, to convince her against disclosing these…misconceptions. But, you see, I also heard something disturbing about her. A woman fitting my description was seen heading towards the swamps.” Freya finished, eyes shimmering with unexpected tears.\n\nWinston took a moment to consider her words, nodding slowly, \"You've been very helpful, Freya.

Even last week, I was at the dojo practicing with my favorite, a sai.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston hummed, a non-committal sound as he mentally filed away the information. He peered at the open spot in the case shaping a sai- the exact style like the weapon found in Jess and seemingly missing from the collection. He remembered the local authorities report about a matching weapon disappearing recently. \n\nShifting his focus back on Freya, Winston decided to delve deeper. \"And you frequent the local dojo, am I correct?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" Freya piped, curious. \"I was there just last week.\"\n\n\"And Jess,\" Winston moved on. \"You seem to have spent quite a sum to gain some insight on her.\"\n\nFlustered, Freya breathed heavily, \"Yes, I hired a private investigator. Jess started playing games, bragging about dirt she claimed to have on me.\"\n\n\"How does bird-watching tie into these games?\" Winston questioned, casually dropping a seemingly unrelated question.\n\nTaken aback, Freya chuckled awkwardly, \"Well detective, I do frequent the swamp near here to observe the local birdlife. And yes, my car was indeed spotted parked there recently.\"\n\nSeizing the moment, Winston probed, \"So you would be quite familiar with navigating the swamplands then?\" \n\nFreya gritted her teeth, \"Yes, Detective. As I said, I often go there. My father taught me how to navigate those swamps.\"\n\nNext he opened his folder, producing the letter meant for the local paper, written by Jess. Winston watched as Freya's reactions shifted from surprise to anger, to a controlled calm. It spoke volumes more than her carefully composed words, \"Jess threw accusations left and right, yes. I asked our mutual friends to intervene, to convince her against disclosing these…misconceptions. But, you see, I also heard something disturbing about her. A woman fitting my description was seen heading towards the swamps.” Freya finished, eyes shimmering with unexpected tears.\n\nWinston took a moment to consider her words, nodding slowly, \"You've been very helpful, Freya. Thank you.\" His mind still picking on the revelations, the omissions, the twitches, keeping him aware that the game's just begun.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Her body in the wrestling ring lay in stark contrast to her living self in Winston's memory, where he last saw her in a bustling car dealership owned by Miles. This same dealership was now part of a growing crime scene.\n\nMiles was known as the dealer that could talk anyone into buying anything. His charm had woven him into all sorts of events and situations, some more suspect than others. One such situation led to a wrestling match between him and Sophie, his main political opponent.

Despite the recent tragic events, she still had plans to publicly expose his crimes.\n\nThe occurrences at the wrestling ring and the car lot were definitely cause for speculation, considering the complex relationship between Miles and Sophie.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the ominous arena of a wrestling ring, Sophie's life was unexpected cut short by the deadly crack of a pistol; now it's up to grizzled Detective Winston to interrogate suspects Willard and Miles, unmasking the murderer among them.\n\nWinston tapped his finger gently on the folder marked 'Sophie,' his deep-set eyes brooding over the troubling police files. The latest files had pointed him towards the infamous chiropractor suspect, Willard.\n\nHis first priority was a discussion with Willard's family. Winston sensed a tension within the household, their nervous smiles barely managing to disguise the concern emanating from their eyes. Their excessive cordiality did not help to ease Winston’s suspicions either. \n\n\"One moment he is here, the next, he's disappeared... Always been a man of mystery, our Willard,\" said one of the family members, echoing the general sentiment. Winston committed to memory the statement about Willard's irregular attendance and early departures from family events.\n\nIn one conversation, the family mentioned an episode from Willard's past serving in the military. The proud march, the calling to arms and patriotic chants echoed with a fleeting gleam in their eyes, tracing back the glory days when Willard underwent firearm training. A chill began to creep into Winston, but he pushed it back, refusing to draw any conclusions just yet.\n\nThe family shared how they were constantly trying to get in touch with Willard, their frantic attempts being met with obstinate silence and evasions. A phone filled with incoming calls from various family members had apparently been a common sight for Willard, but he purposefully avoided their calls.\n\nIrrefutable evidence was uncovered in the case file: Sophie had falsely accused Willard of malpractice. Despite this, Sophie's persistence won her the court case against Willard. The court controversially ratified the baseless malpractice accusations, resulting in the termination of Willard's work license.\n\nLife had not been kind to Willard post that trial. Once a cherished medical professional of the town, he now used robust protective tools in his new, mundane job. The heavy, clinical gloves sparkling immaculately under the sterile clinic lights were perhaps the last vestiges of his once illustrious career.\n\nOne of Willard’s former military buddies had noted his self-protection apparatus, a gun safely secured away in accordance with the local laws. No one could fault a man, especially one trained in the military, for taking the necessary precautions to secure the safety of his own home, could they?\n\nWith the stage set precisely as Sophie desired, she dug Willard's downfall deep and mercurial. However, it was clear to Winston that Sophie's claims in court were indeed more hype than truth. It was a meticulously orchestrated theatre for public consumption and Sophie was the skilled puppeteer.\n\nAs he navigated through the complicated tales of Willard's case, he couldn’t shake off the eerie feeling that Willard's peripheral existence carried more depth than what met the eye. But jumping to conclusions was never Winston's style. For now, all the facts and tales added another layer to the mysterious puzzle that is Willard.\n\nIn the aftermath of a wrestling event, Winston was analyzing the chaos that had unraveled. The area, now void of its once fervent spectators, was shrouded in silence broken only by the solemn presence of Sophie's lifeless body.\n\nSophie, ever the ambitious woman, had divided her time between her political career where she was pitted against the likes of Miles, and other interests - in this case, wrestling. Her body in the wrestling ring lay in stark contrast to her living self in Winston's memory, where he last saw her in a bustling car dealership owned by Miles. This same dealership was now part of a growing crime scene.\n\nMiles was known as the dealer that could talk anyone into buying anything. His charm had woven him into all sorts of events and situations, some more suspect than others. One such situation led to a wrestling match between him and Sophie, his main political opponent. The high energy from the crowd that night still hung in the air, their wild cheers a testament to the fierce competition that had just taken place.\n\nWhen Winston visited Miles's car dealership, he was greeted with the sight of glossy sportscars, family sedans, and even a few police issue vehicles. The latter was part of Miles's specialty - police vehicles equipped with pistols, ready to serve the needs of law enforcement.\n\nWinston turned a critical eye to Miles's inventory, prompting him to say, \"Quite the setup you got here,\" as he made his way into Miles’s office for a meeting. The layers of obfuscation that Miles attempted with his cheerful demeanor did nothing to dissuade Winston from the degree of Miles's unease.\n\n\"Oh, you know, business has been good,\" Miles deflected.\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Winston returned, \"Especially when you're financing a competing candidate behind Sophie's political campaign.\" Surprised by Winston's directness, Miles stuttered momentarily before feigning indifference.\n\nStruggling to move on, Miles attempted a change of topic by focussing on Sophie's ability to wrestle both physically and politically. \"You must have seen her wrestle, right?\"\n\n\"I did, indeed,\" Winston replied, catching the guilt that attempted to hide behind Miles' uneasy laughter.\n\nWinston knew that while Sophie occasionally wrestled for sport, she also wrestled with the truth. The evidence she collected was slowly uncovering illegal activities linked back to Miles's car dealership; specifically, money laundering. Despite the recent tragic events, she still had plans to publicly expose his crimes.\n\nThe occurrences at the wrestling ring and the car lot were definitely cause for speculation, considering the complex relationship between Miles and Sophie. Sophie's bodyguard had recently bought a police vehicle from Miles's dealership, a purchase that led him to discover a pistol, identical to the one found at the scene of Sophie's death. A question hung in the air - did Miles know about it?\n\nAs Winston excused himself from the meeting, he reflected upon Miles’s desperation to protect his reputation and livelihood. A formidable adversary like Sophie was certainly not a threat Miles could simply ignore. With each passing moment, it was becoming increasingly clear that this was just the beginning of their investigation.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Willard\nB.

The scene was grim, even for a seasoned detective. The body of Jesse, a young boy, had been found. The murder weapon, found near his body, was a lawnmower, an odd choice for a murder weapon, especially in a rainforest.\n\nOne suspect was Jesse's fellow schoolmate, Sam. His name had surfaced around the investigation thanks to a tip-off from the school janitor. The man remembered seeing Sam at the lost and found desk, writing something.\n\nIt appears that Sam had found some incriminating texts on his girlfriend's phone, all of which were sent by Jesse. When confronted, Sam's girlfriend confessed that she had been seeing Jesse behind Sam's back. This all coincided with the fact that Sam had access to paper and pen during his visit to the lost and found desk. Winston also learned that the numbers from the confiscated phones were noted down on a piece of paper.\n\nThe field trip group Sam and Jesse were part of were the only ones in the rainforest that day. Sam was among them, having also been given special privileges, being the only student allowed to access the lost and found box. Winston made yet another note of it. \n\n\"Winston,\" a fellow detective called out, causing Winston to look up. \n\n\"What is it?\" He asked, heading towards the man.\n\n\"Just wanted you to know, we've seized the phones. The numbers were written down.\"\n\n\"On paper?\"\n\nThe detective nodded, \"Yeah. At the lost and found desk, from what we've heard.\"\n\nWinston's eyes squinted as he thought. He knew these facts were significant, but their connection was not clear. \n\n\"Okay. Thanks.\" Giving him a nod, he moved towards his vehicle. \n\nHis mind whirled with facts as he started the car. Conversations with Sam, his fellow schoolmate's murder, confessions from his girlfriend, and peculiar facts from a field trip in the rainforest. \n\nHe knew his job wasn't done until he found justice for Jesse, until he was able to connect the dots and bring the story together.

A call had come in, a body, Jesse's, found in the woods. As the victims' details appeared on his screen in flickering neon blue, Winston registered one significant point that had yet to be confirmed - the murder weapon was a lawnmower.\n\nUpon arriving at the scene, he climbed out of the car, his shoes squishing and sliding in the mud. It was time to pay a visit to the prime suspect, Steve, a dedicated Rabbi trying to make ends meet.\n\nHis visit to Steve was brief but loaded with significant information. To the unsuspecting, Steve was a devout religious leader and a generous individual who devoted his time to frequent forest clean-ups, never too busy to lend a hand with his own set of lawnmowers.\n\n\"Lately, my congregation has been dwindling, \" Steve confessed. \"I had to set up a lawn care business to support myself and the synagogue.\"\n\nWhile Steve rambled, Winston learned more about Jesse's aggressive approach to business. \"Jesse... he had an ambitious streak. I couldn't compete,\" Steve admitted, \"He was systematically undercutting my prices, offering ridiculous summer discounts and premium services.\"\n\nThis confirmed Winston's suspicion that Jesse had not only been a rival but was planning to put Steve out of business. Steve, however, was not unaware. He suspected Jesse of stealing his clientele and provided evidence to Winston. Steve's business was shrinking while Jesse's was blooming, a fact evidenced by the bitterness lurking in the Steve's voice whenever Jesse was mentioned.\n\nWinston, maintaining a stone face, asked about Steve's activities on the day of the murder. As if on cue, Steve informed him that there was a clean-up event on that same fateful day, occurring at the exact time Jesse met his grisly end.\n\nOfficers at the scene had confirmed the unusual chains of Steve's lawnmower as the cause of death.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the heart of the rainforest, Jesse meets his gruesome end by a lawnmower, leaving Detective Winston embarked on a puzzling quest with suspects - Sam and Steve.\n\nDetective Winston stood at the edge of the rainforest, reviewing his notes. The scene was grim, even for a seasoned detective. The body of Jesse, a young boy, had been found. The murder weapon, found near his body, was a lawnmower, an odd choice for a murder weapon, especially in a rainforest.\n\nOne suspect was Jesse's fellow schoolmate, Sam. His name had surfaced around the investigation thanks to a tip-off from the school janitor. The man remembered seeing Sam at the lost and found desk, writing something.\n\nIt appears that Sam had found some incriminating texts on his girlfriend's phone, all of which were sent by Jesse. When confronted, Sam's girlfriend confessed that she had been seeing Jesse behind Sam's back. This all coincided with the fact that Sam had access to paper and pen during his visit to the lost and found desk. Winston also learned that the numbers from the confiscated phones were noted down on a piece of paper.\n\nThe field trip group Sam and Jesse were part of were the only ones in the rainforest that day. Sam was among them, having also been given special privileges, being the only student allowed to access the lost and found box. Winston made yet another note of it. \n\n\"Winston,\" a fellow detective called out, causing Winston to look up. \n\n\"What is it?\" He asked, heading towards the man.\n\n\"Just wanted you to know, we've seized the phones. The numbers were written down.\"\n\n\"On paper?\"\n\nThe detective nodded, \"Yeah. At the lost and found desk, from what we've heard.\"\n\nWinston's eyes squinted as he thought. He knew these facts were significant, but their connection was not clear. \n\n\"Okay. Thanks.\" Giving him a nod, he moved towards his vehicle. \n\nHis mind whirled with facts as he started the car. Conversations with Sam, his fellow schoolmate's murder, confessions from his girlfriend, and peculiar facts from a field trip in the rainforest. \n\nHe knew his job wasn't done until he found justice for Jesse, until he was able to connect the dots and bring the story together. For now, he just needed to keep gathering facts and truths. \n\nEvery puzzle piece counted.\n\nRain pattered on the windshield as detective Winston drove toward the rainforest. A call had come in, a body, Jesse's, found in the woods. As the victims' details appeared on his screen in flickering neon blue, Winston registered one significant point that had yet to be confirmed - the murder weapon was a lawnmower.\n\nUpon arriving at the scene, he climbed out of the car, his shoes squishing and sliding in the mud. It was time to pay a visit to the prime suspect, Steve, a dedicated Rabbi trying to make ends meet.\n\nHis visit to Steve was brief but loaded with significant information. To the unsuspecting, Steve was a devout religious leader and a generous individual who devoted his time to frequent forest clean-ups, never too busy to lend a hand with his own set of lawnmowers.\n\n\"Lately, my congregation has been dwindling, \" Steve confessed. \"I had to set up a lawn care business to support myself and the synagogue.\"\n\nWhile Steve rambled, Winston learned more about Jesse's aggressive approach to business. \"Jesse... he had an ambitious streak. I couldn't compete,\" Steve admitted, \"He was systematically undercutting my prices, offering ridiculous summer discounts and premium services.\"\n\nThis confirmed Winston's suspicion that Jesse had not only been a rival but was planning to put Steve out of business. Steve, however, was not unaware. He suspected Jesse of stealing his clientele and provided evidence to Winston. Steve's business was shrinking while Jesse's was blooming, a fact evidenced by the bitterness lurking in the Steve's voice whenever Jesse was mentioned.\n\nWinston, maintaining a stone face, asked about Steve's activities on the day of the murder. As if on cue, Steve informed him that there was a clean-up event on that same fateful day, occurring at the exact time Jesse met his grisly end.\n\nOfficers at the scene had confirmed the unusual chains of Steve's lawnmower as the cause of death. Oddly enough, Steve owned several lawnmowers, all part of his lawn care business, and he was more than proficient in their operation.\n\nAs Winston drove away, he filed away the various pieces of this entangled puzzle. With Steve's confession, Jesse's ambitious undercutting plan, Steve's rapidly decreasing list of clientele, and the coinciding timing of the clean-up event, this case was far from over.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

Though Josephine herself had invited Dale over on that day, this fact disturbed Winston.\n\nDale, the electrician, had expert knowledge of circuitry and chemical reactions – which, although it was a part of his job, was now a circumstance under suspicion. His workplace, a goldmine of potential explosive materials, didn't make this any easier. This alarmed Winston in tandem as he scanned Dale's records, highlighting his recent career shift to being an electrician after quitting his other jobs.\n\nThese findings alongside the shocking fact of Josephine dating someone else and the violent reaction from Dale led Winston to a turning point. Tired but determined, he gave the evidence another look before closing off for the day.\n\nWith an incessant buzzing of thoughts in his mind, he knew this was a story craving an ending. Winston prepared to confront Dale for the truth, with the hope of unearthing answers. A face-to-face meeting might reveal crucial details that could put an end to this haunting case.\n\nWinston slowly sipped on his room temperature coffee, as unravelling the truth about Josephine's explosion case was giving him sleepless nights. Amongst the suspects was Letti, a devoted employee who had been working tirelessly for Josephine's company for many years. Not only did she work there but, as a testament to her service, she also functioned as a home help at Josephine's residence. The woman, often praised for her work ethic, was known to have flung herself into her work with an even greater intensity recently, driven by the ongoing quest for a promotion she’d been working hard towards for years.\n\nEarlier, Letti and Josephine had an argument about their respective professional footings. Letti was seen to be quite upset, crying in the restroom. Surprisingly, right after that emotional storm, Letti was observed chatting blithely on the phone. \n\nJust last week, in her pursuit of the much-desired promotion, Letti had managed to complete multiple projects ahead of schedule. It wasn't typical for her, Winston mused, remembering the unopened letters from bill collectors and overdue notices the diligent Letti was grappling with. Perhaps, the dire need of a salary bump had evoked these sudden bursts of energy.\n\nTaking another sip, Winston leafed through the case notes and moved on to another interesting piece of information. Over the past week, the once punctual Letti had slipped in several project deadlines. It was strange how someone with a voracious desire to earn a promotion could allow her work to falter. It somehow didn't add up. \n\nMore intriguing yet, was a curious observation of one of Josephine's housemaids. Letti had been spotted in the vicinity of Josephine's home around the same time as the explosion. Coupled with the fact that Josephine had trusted her long-serving employee enough to give her a spare key, it gave rise to a few awkward questions. \n\nDespite her struggles, Letti was not immune to the natural human envy. Despite being a junior, Josephine's professional life was soaring, and Letti was known to openly express her envy at Josephine's success.\n\nIn her professional surroundings, especially during the ongoing week, Letti was seen to be acting oddly, her mood swings noted by many. Her turbulent emotional state was unlike her; it had become a discussion point among fellow workers. It seemed that the exceptional efforts she made in sustaining her long career had taken a heavy toll on the otherwise resilient lady.\n\nAs Winston put down the notes, he remembered a crucial yet puzzling factor. Despite the ladies being colleagues, Josephine had just recently joined and was being considered for the promotion that Letti had been laboring hard for years to attain.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nAn explosion rocking a suburban home leads Detective Winston into a web of deception and intrigue as he investigates the untimely death of Josephine, with prime suspects Dale and Letti under the microscope.\n\nWinston sighed, pushing away from his desk to scan the bulletin board full of grim photos and hasty scribblings. This case was unfortunate, a heavy weight pressing down hard on Winston's shoulders. \n\nCafé Strange Brew, had been a regular haunt for Josephine and, coincidentally, also for Dale. Winston himself had spoken to the former barista, who claimed to have seen Dale monitoring Josephine almost obsessively. Yes, he noticed that Dale was always hovering where Josephine was.\n\nUpon contacting the mayor's office to verify a lead, Winston heard that Dale was angrily seen yelling at Josephine in town on that fateful day. He had just discovered that she was dating someone. The scene happened in the town hall, being the center of all activities, was an accurate place to get such information. Not only that, but several witnesses had also reported seeing Dale around various parts of town that day, adding more weight to the evidence.\n\nSince Dale had an undergrad degree in Chemistry, its significance to the case began to unfold for Winston. He looked through the copies of Dale's college records he'd acquired, the deciphering relevance to what was happening.\n\nAs per the testimony from Josephine's neighbor, who happened to see Dale leaving her house, no one else was there at the time. Though Josephine herself had invited Dale over on that day, this fact disturbed Winston.\n\nDale, the electrician, had expert knowledge of circuitry and chemical reactions – which, although it was a part of his job, was now a circumstance under suspicion. His workplace, a goldmine of potential explosive materials, didn't make this any easier. This alarmed Winston in tandem as he scanned Dale's records, highlighting his recent career shift to being an electrician after quitting his other jobs.\n\nThese findings alongside the shocking fact of Josephine dating someone else and the violent reaction from Dale led Winston to a turning point. Tired but determined, he gave the evidence another look before closing off for the day.\n\nWith an incessant buzzing of thoughts in his mind, he knew this was a story craving an ending. Winston prepared to confront Dale for the truth, with the hope of unearthing answers. A face-to-face meeting might reveal crucial details that could put an end to this haunting case.\n\nWinston slowly sipped on his room temperature coffee, as unravelling the truth about Josephine's explosion case was giving him sleepless nights. Amongst the suspects was Letti, a devoted employee who had been working tirelessly for Josephine's company for many years. Not only did she work there but, as a testament to her service, she also functioned as a home help at Josephine's residence. The woman, often praised for her work ethic, was known to have flung herself into her work with an even greater intensity recently, driven by the ongoing quest for a promotion she’d been working hard towards for years.\n\nEarlier, Letti and Josephine had an argument about their respective professional footings. Letti was seen to be quite upset, crying in the restroom. Surprisingly, right after that emotional storm, Letti was observed chatting blithely on the phone. \n\nJust last week, in her pursuit of the much-desired promotion, Letti had managed to complete multiple projects ahead of schedule. It wasn't typical for her, Winston mused, remembering the unopened letters from bill collectors and overdue notices the diligent Letti was grappling with. Perhaps, the dire need of a salary bump had evoked these sudden bursts of energy.\n\nTaking another sip, Winston leafed through the case notes and moved on to another interesting piece of information. Over the past week, the once punctual Letti had slipped in several project deadlines. It was strange how someone with a voracious desire to earn a promotion could allow her work to falter. It somehow didn't add up. \n\nMore intriguing yet, was a curious observation of one of Josephine's housemaids. Letti had been spotted in the vicinity of Josephine's home around the same time as the explosion. Coupled with the fact that Josephine had trusted her long-serving employee enough to give her a spare key, it gave rise to a few awkward questions. \n\nDespite her struggles, Letti was not immune to the natural human envy. Despite being a junior, Josephine's professional life was soaring, and Letti was known to openly express her envy at Josephine's success.\n\nIn her professional surroundings, especially during the ongoing week, Letti was seen to be acting oddly, her mood swings noted by many. Her turbulent emotional state was unlike her; it had become a discussion point among fellow workers. It seemed that the exceptional efforts she made in sustaining her long career had taken a heavy toll on the otherwise resilient lady.\n\nAs Winston put down the notes, he remembered a crucial yet puzzling factor. Despite the ladies being colleagues, Josephine had just recently joined and was being considered for the promotion that Letti had been laboring hard for years to attain. Yet, Josephine was alone in her house that day when her life was claimed. Winston drained his cold coffee and sighed; unraveling this case was still far from reach.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Dale\nB.

Isabella was a young woman murdered in a mosque with a pair of nunchaku. Her case was sent to him because not only was the method of murder unusual but the strange behavior she'd reported was disconcerting.\n\nIsabella had reported suspicious activity to the authorities, claiming an acquaintance named Malaysia was acting out of sorts. The name Malaysia was ringing alarm bells for Winston. The police had already questioned her regarding a theft, and now, with Isabella's murder, he felt the need to dig deeper.\n\nWinston knocked on the door of Malaysia's small home, case files in hand. She was a hairdresser by trade, known to be a fan of martial arts movies, placing Bruce Lee as her idol, and had a knack for practicing martial arts moves at home. She had purchased nunchaku recently.  \n\nWinston was greeted with a jovial smile when he arrived, and once pleasantries were exchanged, his questions began.\n\n“I noticed a uniform in that bag by your door,” Winston nodded towards the corner of the room. “You do martial arts?”\n\n“Sure do,” she replied cheerfully. “Nothing like a little kick and a punch after a long day, especially after watching a good martial arts movie.”\n\nWinston watched her closely but Malaysia seemed to only speak the truth. “Did you ever take martial arts classes?”\n\nMalaysia chuckled, “Does high school count? I took it for a few years then. I was a Bruce Lee in the making.”\n\nHe took a deep breath and continued, “What about your family, Malaysia?” Winston asked, trying to dig into her background. \n\nMalaysia shrugged. “Well detective, it's as erratic as the weather these days. Speaking of which, I do believe we are in for some rain later today.\"\n\nFeeling slightly exasperated, Winston decided to prod a bit more. \"And your love life, Malaysia?\" he asked. \n\n\"Oh, it's like 'Gone With The Wind',\" she replied, winking at him. \"An epic which suddenly disappears. Like any good movie, wouldn't you agree, Winston?\"\n\nHe decided to tread lightly. “You ever practice with nunchaku?”\n\nMalaysia’s gaze never wavered, “Oh, sure. Bought a pair recently. They came in handy when Isabella tried taking my TV. Those are some nice detective notes you've got there around a theft, happened a few days ago, isn't it? The police already asked me about those.\"\n\nAs Winston left Malaysia's home, he was left with a feeling of uncertainty. There was much to unravel about this peculiar woman, and he still couldn’t shake off the uneasy feeling of her jovial exterior that hid a string of suspicious facts. Isabella might have been gone, but Winston was determined to uncover the truth for her sake.\n\nWinston eyed the austere environment of the mosque, draped in silence and shadows. As he looked at this deserted place of worship, he thought of the vibrant Isabella, now lying lifeless.\n\nRemembering his conversations with Isabella's friends, he couldn't help but recall them saying how determined she was to escape Richard for good. Isabella's friends had mentioned her to him - how she told them she intended to finally break free from Richard permanently.\n\nHe decided to talk to Richard, a local waiter who had been working at the mosque during those deserted, deadly hours that took Isabella's life.\n\nRichard stood by the main entryway, enduring the barrage of lights and unfamiliar faces. Winston recognized him from his not-so-distant encounter with the law - a case of domestic violence involving him and Isabella.\n\n\"Evening, Richard,\" Winston started, extending a friendly hand. \"Been working here long?\"\n\n\"Few months, sir,\" Richard replied, his voice steady. \"Only serve the occasional visitor during the day.

A martial arts class, wasn't it?\"\n\nRichard's gaze flickered with surprise before he recovered, his professional mask back in place. \"Yes. Same class as Isabella.\"\n\nWinston recalled seeing Richard in that martial arts class, practicing nunchaku - the same weapon that had ended Isabella's life. And not too long ago, he had seen him at the local sports equipment store, purchasing a set of nunchaku.\n\n\"Quite a skill you've got there,\" Winston continued, keeping his voice casual. \"Heard you and Isabella trained together.\"\n\nRichard sighed, his gaze flicked towards the mosque's silent dome. \"Yeah, we both were there. Couldn't seem to get away from each other.”\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Winston agreed. Neighbors had reported frequently hearing the couple arguing, their quarrels escalating in intensity. \"How was Isabella doing?\"\n\nRichard paused, his brow furrowed. \"She... She was... planning to leave.\"\n\n\"Leave?\" Winston asked, knowing that Isabella had finally decided to break free from Richard permanently.

Isabella might have been gone, but Winston was determined to uncover the truth for her sake.\n\nWinston eyed the austere environment of the mosque, draped in silence and shadows. As he looked at this deserted place of worship, he thought of the vibrant Isabella, now lying lifeless.\n\nRemembering his conversations with Isabella's friends, he couldn't help but recall them saying how determined she was to escape Richard for good. Isabella's friends had mentioned her to him - how she told them she intended to finally break free from Richard permanently.\n\nHe decided to talk to Richard, a local waiter who had been working at the mosque during those deserted, deadly hours that took Isabella's life.\n\nRichard stood by the main entryway, enduring the barrage of lights and unfamiliar faces. Winston recognized him from his not-so-distant encounter with the law - a case of domestic violence involving him and Isabella.\n\n\"Evening, Richard,\" Winston started, extending a friendly hand. \"Been working here long?\"\n\n\"Few months, sir,\" Richard replied, his voice steady. \"Only serve the occasional visitor during the day. I was alone yesterday. No one else was here.\"\n\nWinston nodded, making a mental note of Richard's presence at the mosque during the time of Isabella's murder. \"I've seen you before. A martial arts class, wasn't it?\"\n\nRichard's gaze flickered with surprise before he recovered, his professional mask back in place. \"Yes. Same class as Isabella.\"\n\nWinston recalled seeing Richard in that martial arts class, practicing nunchaku - the same weapon that had ended Isabella's life. And not too long ago, he had seen him at the local sports equipment store, purchasing a set of nunchaku.\n\n\"Quite a skill you've got there,\" Winston continued, keeping his voice casual. \"Heard you and Isabella trained together.\"\n\nRichard sighed, his gaze flicked towards the mosque's silent dome. \"Yeah, we both were there. Couldn't seem to get away from each other.”\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Winston agreed. Neighbors had reported frequently hearing the couple arguing, their quarrels escalating in intensity. \"How was Isabella doing?\"\n\nRichard paused, his brow furrowed. \"She... She was... planning to leave.\"\n\n\"Leave?\" Winston asked, knowing that Isabella had finally decided to break free from Richard permanently. She had even confided in her friends about her escape plans and purchased a ticket for a one-way trip out of the country.\n\n\"Yes...\" Richard's voice was barely audible. \"Leave me. Leave everything.\"\n\nWith that, Winston thanked Richard and turned to leave, his thoughts spinning around the tragic tale of Isabella, her life brutally ended in this quiet mosque she had formerly sought peace.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the mystifying quiet of a mosque, Isabella was found lifeless, a nunchaku the lone cause, casting Detective Winston into a whirlwind investigation with suspects Malaysia and Richard at the heart of the mystery.\n\nDetective Winston was in his office, pouring over the facts of the Isabella case. Isabella was a young woman murdered in a mosque with a pair of nunchaku. Her case was sent to him because not only was the method of murder unusual but the strange behavior she'd reported was disconcerting.\n\nIsabella had reported suspicious activity to the authorities, claiming an acquaintance named Malaysia was acting out of sorts. The name Malaysia was ringing alarm bells for Winston. The police had already questioned her regarding a theft, and now, with Isabella's murder, he felt the need to dig deeper.\n\nWinston knocked on the door of Malaysia's small home, case files in hand. She was a hairdresser by trade, known to be a fan of martial arts movies, placing Bruce Lee as her idol, and had a knack for practicing martial arts moves at home. She had purchased nunchaku recently.  \n\nWinston was greeted with a jovial smile when he arrived, and once pleasantries were exchanged, his questions began.\n\n“I noticed a uniform in that bag by your door,” Winston nodded towards the corner of the room. “You do martial arts?”\n\n“Sure do,” she replied cheerfully. “Nothing like a little kick and a punch after a long day, especially after watching a good martial arts movie.”\n\nWinston watched her closely but Malaysia seemed to only speak the truth. “Did you ever take martial arts classes?”\n\nMalaysia chuckled, “Does high school count? I took it for a few years then. I was a Bruce Lee in the making.”\n\nHe took a deep breath and continued, “What about your family, Malaysia?” Winston asked, trying to dig into her background. \n\nMalaysia shrugged. “Well detective, it's as erratic as the weather these days. Speaking of which, I do believe we are in for some rain later today.\"\n\nFeeling slightly exasperated, Winston decided to prod a bit more. \"And your love life, Malaysia?\" he asked. \n\n\"Oh, it's like 'Gone With The Wind',\" she replied, winking at him. \"An epic which suddenly disappears. Like any good movie, wouldn't you agree, Winston?\"\n\nHe decided to tread lightly. “You ever practice with nunchaku?”\n\nMalaysia’s gaze never wavered, “Oh, sure. Bought a pair recently. They came in handy when Isabella tried taking my TV. Those are some nice detective notes you've got there around a theft, happened a few days ago, isn't it? The police already asked me about those.\"\n\nAs Winston left Malaysia's home, he was left with a feeling of uncertainty.

It was like any other mall, a place where people came to shop, to dine, or just hang out. But this was also where Guy was murdered, during the night. The murder weapon was unusual, a sai. The image of the exotic weapon left at the crime scene kept flashing in Winston's mind as he strolled past the familiar storefronts. \n\nAmong the shops, there was one Peyton frequented. Peyton, Guy's own niece, an avid shopper who worked daytime shifts, always made it a point to visit the mall at night, and a martial artist. As formal as it may seem, the shopping habits of a suspect was something Winston had to keep in mind.\n\nTalking to one of Peyton’s martial arts instructors, he confirmed that Peyton was proficient in sai handling. They certainly weren’t everyday weaponry, rather, they were often regarded as collectors’ items, a hobby that Peyton happened to pursue uncharacteristically.\n\n\"Peyton works her daytime shifts and would be here in the evening, for her shopping sprees or fitness routines,\" the instructor said, recalling Peyton's routine. It made sense; the mall was a perfect place to balance work and a passionate interest in martial arts whilst enjoying a harmless love for shopping.\n\n\"What about her character?\" Winston probed, trying to learn more without leading. \n\"Peyton always talks about protecting her family's reputation. She said she would do anything for them,\" the instructor said, a faint hint of admiration in his eyes. \n\nStudying the family history, Winston found that Guy was about to confess something, something so significant that it would inevitably ruin Peyton's family, specifically her father. Guy had unearthed evidence linking Peyton's father to numerous past criminal activities. If he'd gone public, it would have led to a scandal that would shake the foundations of the pedigreed family.\n\nAt Peyton's home, every corner of the room was adorned with mementos of her passion, martial arts. Carefully preserved in glass cases were weapons of all sorts. Among these were sais; eyes identical to the one found at the crime scene. Payton loved collecting these. They were her treasures.\n\nWhile driving back, Winston repeatedly went over the facts in his head: Peyton’s profession with the sai, her uncovered collection, her father's looming scandal, and the murder scene that she frequented at night. \n\nHis task was to detect, not deduce. The tapestry of facts was there. It was up to the jury and the readers to weave it into a verdict.\n\nWinston slumped into a barstool at \"Isolde's Spirits\", a pint-sized dive nested in the rougher end of town. The place was known for its assortment of DVDs showcasing a range of action films, expertly narrated by the bartender herself - Isolde.\n\n\"Care for a drink, detective?\" Isolde asked. Lined on the walls were rows of DVDs, each painstakingly organized by genre. Pointing to the DVDs, she said, \"These here are some real masterpieces, detective. Exquisite plot twists, wouldn't you agree?\" She was known to frequently reference these films in her speeches at the bar, sometimes mimicking the martial arts scenes with one of the sai daggers from her collection behind the counter.\n\nWhile directing Winston's attention to the action films, she wistfully added, \"I often recommend these to my customers, especially the martial arts ones. Excellent stuff.\"\n\n\"I'd imagine so. Mixing cocktails and quoting movies.. sounds like good business.\" Winston remarked, while casually glancing at a missing spot on the wall with a DVD of a popular martial arts film. \n\n\"Must've lent it to someone, they love my recommendations.\" Isolde laughed, echoing lines from the films as she served her drinks.\n\nAs the evening wore on, Winston noticed a distinct lack of regulars from Guy's ethnicity, and a sign posted behind the counter sternly clarifying a 'no people of Guy's ethnicity' policy. A replacer behind the bar informed him that Guy, a member of his community, was extremely distressed by the racially insensitive remarks Isolde had made at the bar, hence, her decision to implement this policy.\n\n\"New policy?\" Winston inquired, nodding towards the sign.\n\n\"You could say that's been a longstanding rule around here,\" Isolde replied, a touch of steel underlying her voice. Taking a moment to reflect, Winston remembered an official complaint request he had received about a week ago. Guy had brought up a case against Isolde for her consistent racial insults.\n\nHer racism wasn't the only thing Winston was dissecting that night. High up on the wall, behind Isolde, the detective noticed a single sai dagger missing from a martial arts weapon set - the same set, he remembered, from which the murder weapon in Guy's case had been seized.\n\nHe had seen Isolde at her martial arts school, not far from this spot. She held a high rank there - a black belt - and he specifically recalled seeing her practices involving a sai. \"You train with a sai, black belt, right?\"\n\n\"Rank matters less than experience, detective,\" Isolde replied, her attention briefly flickering to the gap in her weapon collection.\n\nSuddenly, her recitation of lines from one of the martial arts dramas she played so often became chilling. Winston was reminded of the CCTV footage from the shopping mall where Guy was murdered.\n\nAs the night aged and his senses became weighted with the notes of the narrative she wove drawn from the discourses of her beloved films, he became aware of the spider web that began to form around them - a delicate filigree wrought of details only a detective would fold in his case notebook.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA.

For example if the answer was E, you should answer \\boxed{E}.\n\nNarrative:\nIn the shimmering depths of a popular scuba diving site, Julian's life was brutally extinguished with a crowbar; now, it's up to Detective Winston to dive into the murky secrets of suspects Lucy and Clara.\n\nDetective Winston sat in his office, massaging his temples as he rifled through files. Information was abundant—the murder of Julian, committed at a scuba diving site, the involvement of a certain piece of equipment, a crowbar, and a suspect, Lucy, passenger on the same boat. The friend of the deceased, they dived together often, and the current dive was only meant for a small group, to which Lucy and Julian had belonged. It was interesting, how close they were, especially after Lucy found evidence of Julian's planned betrayal in his belongings, causing her significant harm. Moreover, Lucy mentioned how she was privy to Julian discussing his betrayal with another person while on their diving trips.\n\nGlancing at the clock, Winston grabbed his jacket from the back of his chair.\n\nHe arrived outside of Lucy's house. The lights were dim, and music softly drifted out from a cracked window. John's house stood adjacent, a zoo of life contrasting the quietly serene ambiance of Lucy's yard.\n\nWinston knocked, waiting patiently before being greeted by a man whose tired eyes glinted suspiciously. \"Lucy allows you inside?\" he queried.\n\nWinston nodded, \"Yes, she said she will be available.\"\n\nJohn, a night-worker, usually checked his surroundings before heading to bed. From his window, one had a clear view of Lucy's house. Winston made a mental note of it before he walked towards her porch light's glow.\n\nInside, Lucy cleared her throat, \"I'm usually in bed by nine, but you're welcome to stay. Would you like something to drink, detective?\" \n\n\"No, thank you,\" He responded, letting his gaze move over the room.\n\nThrough their conversation, it became clear that Lucy didn't have any reason, such as work, to stay awake past her aforementioned bedtime.  \n\nWinston tilted his head slightly, \"You and Julian were part of a small group?\"\n\nLucy nodded and mumbled, \"Yes. We used to dive together frequently. Julian always kept his gear in the locker room.\"\n\n\"And you had the privilege to access?\" Winston inquired.\n\nShe affirmed with a nod. \"I was the only person allowed in his locker.\"\n\nWinston chose not to reply. Instead, he excused himself and took his leave.\n\nWinston went over the evening in his head as he drove away, the mysterious irony of it all playing out before him. The pieces of puzzle were there, scattered but there, ready to be joined. But the one making the most noise was this— Julian's past actions causing harm to Lucy, his subsequent betrayal, and Lucy being privy to it all due to her overhearing his discussions.\n\nTrust is a fragile thing—it takes years to build but seconds to break.\n\nDetective Winston strolled into the bustling office of the metalworking company where the late Julian worked alongside Clara, the latter now under investigation. Clara had been spotted precariously securing her distinctive metalwork, a crowbar, into her car before the tragic dive. Professionalism must remain paramount in such situations, Winston mused, pushing aside the chilling imagery.\n\nAs he reached Julia's workstation, the evidence of her being a workaholic was quite evident. Work was stacked high, along with diving gear stowed in the corner. \"Talented and hardworking,\" Winston mused aloud, making his way to Clara's workspace. Like Julian's, it too was littered with stacks of unfinished work and abandoned tools, a testament of long work hours put into recent projects which, as Winston recalled, Clara had excelled at. \n\nSpotting a few unique pieces, introspective in their design, he overheard a couple of coworkers mentioning Clara's passion and drive, specifically mentioning her enthusiasm at the prospect of obtaining an upcoming promotion. The same promotion, Winston gathered, that both Julia and Clara were contenders for.\n\nThinking through the additional information he had received that Clara was part of the ill-fated diving team, he realized that it made perfect sense. Clara was a known scuba diving enthusiast, something she had in common with Julia. They’d both been scheduled to dive at the same time and location on that fateful day, with Clara volunteering to inspect the equipment.\n\nConsidering these observations, Winston ventured out to the diving site where the incident occurred. He arrived to find the rest of the diving team scouting the area. His presence was duly noted; however, he kept his distance, choosing to observe.\n\nWith the day drawing to a close, Winston had more questions than answers, the clues gathering like puzzle pieces, their fit still untested. Winston had learned that in investigation, not everything was as it appeared, and this case proved no different. It was an intricate tapestry woven with ambition, passion, and an undefined, potentially fatal error. The challenging part was to unravel it without causing more harm than had already been done.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the most likely murderer?\n\nChoices:\nA. Lucy\nB.

This labyrinth had been a significant part of Gary's life; he had spent a lot of time here, and his involvement in its construction was evident. However, it was temporarily closed off to the public on the night of Rosemary's murder. Despite this, her body was found in its interior, beaten down with an iron bar.\n\nGary was the last person seen entering the labyrinth before the time of the murder, according to several witnesses. Since he was the victim's stepson, Winston knew interviewing him was paramount. It was a known fact that the relationship between Gary and his stepmother, Rosemary, was strained - increasingly so after she took a prominent role in the family business administration, a role in which he was majorly overlooked. Winston was interested to know how this resentment towards his stepmother's involvement in their family business might have played into the murder.\n\nJoining Gary, who was engrossed in his laptop, Winston greeted, \"Good evening.\" His greeting was returned with a grudging acknowledgment and a nervous glance towards the laptop. His friend had mentioned that Gary was an avid computer enthusiast - he would always be on his computer after returning from work, diving into the infinite realm that the internet offered, often late into the night. Every night.\n\nIt was this preference for the online world, his friend had noted, where Gary spent a significant amount of his time. \"Your friend tells me you're quite the computer enthusiast,\" Winston ventured, casually making a note of it. Gary's face immediately exhibited discomfort, confirming the hinted behavior.\n\nGary's friend had also mentioned, rather candidly, about multiple incidents where he'd walk into a room to find Gary hurriedly closing his laptop screen. Winston noticed this around the same time he hinted at Gary's online habits.\n\n\"And your stepmother, Rosemary,\" Winston continued, bringing the topic back to the victim. \"She had been part of all major business decisions recently, right?\" he asked intending to stir something out of Gary's resentment.\n\nGary's reply was curt, and while it revealed nothing definite, it was enough for Winston to feel he was coursing along the right path of the mystery, \"Let's just say she fancied herself quite the boss.\"\n\nWinston glanced at the list of facts sprawled over the worn-out brown leather pad. The labyrinth murder of Rosemary was a conundrum he had never encountered in his long career as a detective. Among the suspects, Dale had been banging around in his mind. Architect by profession and by all means, a tough guy, Dale was a regular at the local gym. It was not everyday someone had the physique to swing around an iron bar, let alone kill with it. Furthermore, he had worked on previous projects involving the use of iron bars, a detail Winston considered notable. Dale had even bragged about his strength while lifting these heavy construction materials at one of his projects when the detective had visited as part of his routine checks.\n\nSpeaking of which, the labyrinth was not just any project for Dale. He had full control over its design and construction. Doesn't a spider know its own web the best, Winston mused.\n\nHe reopened the forensic report of Rosemary. The images of her visible bruises were a grim reminder of a dark side to Dale, one few knew. A domestic dispute or two may not prove anything, but loud, recurring arguments heard by neighbors indicated a line had been crossed again and again.\n\nWinston thumbed through the pages and a couple of crucial facts jumped out, once again. Dale had been fighting for the custody of kids. Also, he was terrified of losing all his fortune in divorce, a fact he shared one night a little too generously over bottles of Budweiser.\n\nDale also had a few iron bars missing from his current construction site of the labyrinth. The weapon used for Rosemary’s murder, an iron bar, was not lost on Winston. He recalled seeing the iron bars at the site himself, remembering Dale's past projects involving the same type of material. Someone used to his weight at gym handles, lifting an iron bar wouldn’t be much of a task for Dale, a cold shudder ran down Winston’s spine at that thought. \n\nWinston closed his eyes, trying to fit all the pieces together. The last two pieces were the most troubling. On the day of the crime, Dale was, in fact, seen entering the labyrinth. And the meeting inside the maze was a closed affair, known only to Rosemary and Dale.\n\nWinston rose from his desk and moved to his window, his eyes hypnotically following pedestrians with unbeknownst lives of their own. This labyrinth bore the name ‘Dale’ on each turn, each dead end, each exit and the hidden center. But how would it hold in court? How does a spider catch itself in its own web?

This labyrinth had been a significant part of Gary's life; he had spent a lot of time here, and his involvement in its construction was evident. However, it was temporarily closed off to the public on the night of Rosemary's murder. Despite this, her body was found in its interior, beaten down with an iron bar.\n\nGary was the last person seen entering the labyrinth before the time of the murder, according to several witnesses. Since he was the victim's stepson, Winston knew interviewing him was paramount. It was a known fact that the relationship between Gary and his stepmother, Rosemary, was strained - increasingly so after she took a prominent role in the family business administration, a role in which he was majorly overlooked. Winston was interested to know how this resentment towards his stepmother's involvement in their family business might have played into the murder.\n\nJoining Gary, who was engrossed in his laptop, Winston greeted, \"Good evening.\" His greeting was returned with a grudging acknowledgment and a nervous glance towards the laptop. His friend had mentioned that Gary was an avid computer enthusiast - he would always be on his computer after returning from work, diving into the infinite realm that the internet offered, often late into the night. Every night.\n\nIt was this preference for the online world, his friend had noted, where Gary spent a significant amount of his time. \"Your friend tells me you're quite the computer enthusiast,\" Winston ventured, casually making a note of it. Gary's face immediately exhibited discomfort, confirming the hinted behavior.\n\nGary's friend had also mentioned, rather candidly, about multiple incidents where he'd walk into a room to find Gary hurriedly closing his laptop screen. Winston noticed this around the same time he hinted at Gary's online habits.\n\n\"And your stepmother, Rosemary,\" Winston continued, bringing the topic back to the victim. \"She had been part of all major business decisions recently, right?\" he asked intending to stir something out of Gary's resentment.\n\nGary's reply was curt, and while it revealed nothing definite, it was enough for Winston to feel he was coursing along the right path of the mystery, \"Let's just say she fancied herself quite the boss.\"\n\nWinston glanced at the list of facts sprawled over the worn-out brown leather pad. The labyrinth murder of Rosemary was a conundrum he had never encountered in his long career as a detective. Among the suspects, Dale had been banging around in his mind. Architect by profession and by all means, a tough guy, Dale was a regular at the local gym. It was not everyday someone had the physique to swing around an iron bar, let alone kill with it. Furthermore, he had worked on previous projects involving the use of iron bars, a detail Winston considered notable. Dale had even bragged about his strength while lifting these heavy construction materials at one of his projects when the detective had visited as part of his routine checks.\n\nSpeaking of which, the labyrinth was not just any project for Dale. He had full control over its design and construction. Doesn't a spider know its own web the best, Winston mused.\n\nHe reopened the forensic report of Rosemary. The images of her visible bruises were a grim reminder of a dark side to Dale, one few knew. A domestic dispute or two may not prove anything, but loud, recurring arguments heard by neighbors indicated a line had been crossed again and again.\n\nWinston thumbed through the pages and a couple of crucial facts jumped out, once again. Dale had been fighting for the custody of kids. Also, he was terrified of losing all his fortune in divorce, a fact he shared one night a little too generously over bottles of Budweiser.\n\nDale also had a few iron bars missing from his current construction site of the labyrinth. The weapon used for Rosemary’s murder, an iron bar, was not lost on Winston. He recalled seeing the iron bars at the site himself, remembering Dale's past projects involving the same type of material. Someone used to his weight at gym handles, lifting an iron bar wouldn’t be much of a task for Dale, a cold shudder ran down Winston’s spine at that thought. \n\nWinston closed his eyes, trying to fit all the pieces together. The last two pieces were the most troubling. On the day of the crime, Dale was, in fact, seen entering the labyrinth. And the meeting inside the maze was a closed affair, known only to Rosemary and Dale.\n\nWinston rose from his desk and moved to his window, his eyes hypnotically following pedestrians with unbeknownst lives of their own. This labyrinth bore the name ‘Dale’ on each turn, each dead end, each exit and the hidden center. But how would it hold in court? How does a spider catch itself in its own web?
