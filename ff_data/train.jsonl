Her hand, which gathered a grimy plaid shawl at her throat, trembled ceaselessly from privation, and the vile liquor privation had brought. She was hungry; it seemed to her that she had never eaten. She was cold; it seemed to her that she had never known warmth.</p><p>She crept into a little hallway on the water front. The breeze from the river was not a strong one; but to her it was a hurricane. The drizzling rain hurt her. The minor tones of a bell from a ship at the near-by docks told that it was midnight. With inarticulate moans she crouched down in a corner, closing the door to keep out the wind and rain.</p><p>Something was in the corner, she felt it with her steady hands. It was soft and warm to her touch. A plaintive mew followed. The something was a cat. At first she rather resented its presence. Then she gathered it up in her arms and pressed it against the bosom of her ragged old dress. Here was a creature as miserable as she. It was only a cat, but she felt less lonely with it in her arms. When she had been a little girl she had had a pet kitten.</p><p>Each was cold--the cat and the woman--but each found some warmth in the other. The cat stopped mewing and the woman stopped moaning. The wind had shifted and the rain had ceased. The door swung open again and the moon hanging calmly beautiful among the clouds, shone through the tangle of masts and cordage and into the hallway.</p><p>The woman, crouched in the corner, held the cat as she would have held a child. By-and-by she began to rock slowly to and fro. The clouds drifted away, and the stars joined the moon in peeping through the door.</p><p>The woman’s eyes were closed and she was crooning an old-fashioned lullaby. The cat was very faintly purring and one of its paws rested on her bare neck.

It is only within the last year, however, that it has been discovered that an over-indulgence in dialect stories is liable to bring on an affection of the tongue.</p><p>A peculiarly sad case and the most notable that has thus far been brought to the attention of the public is that of Deacon Azariah Perkins of West Hartford, Connecticut.</p><p>Far from deploring the spread of the dialect story, he reveled in it, reading all the tales that he could get hold of in magazines or circulating library. But his was not a healthy, catholic taste; he had ears and eyes for one dialect alone--the negro. For him Ian Maclaren and Barrie spread their most tempting Scotch jaw-breakers in vain; he had no desire for them. After fifteen years of negro dialect in every form in which Southern and Northern writers can serve it, any specialist in nervous disorders could have told the deacon that he was liable to have ‘negromania’; but West Hartford does not employ specialists, and so the stroke came unheralded, with all the suddenness of apoplexy.</p><p>Deacon Perkins has always been able to think standing; indeed, he has been called the Chauncey Depew of West Hartford, and no revival meeting or strawberry festival or canned clam-bake was considered a success unless the deacon’s ready tongue took part in the exercises.</p><p></p><p>Last Sunday they had a children’s festival in the Congregational Church, and after the children had made an end of reciting and singing, the deacon was called upon for a few remarks. He is a favorite with young and old, and a man of great purity and simplicity of character. He arose with alacrity and walked down the isle with the lumbering gait peculiar to New-Englanders who have struggled with rocky farms the best part of their lives. He ascended the platform steps, inclined his head to the audience, and spoke as follows:</p><p>“Mah deah li’l’ chillun! Yo’ kahnd sup’inten’ent has ast me to mek a few remahks.” (Subdued titters on the part of the scholars.) “Ah don’ s’pose you-all’ll b’lieve me w’en Ah say dat Ah too was once a li’l’ piccaninny same as yo’, but Ah was, an’ Ah ’membeh how mah ol’ mammy use teh tek me to Sunny-school.” (Consternation on the part of the superintendent and teachers.)</p><p>“Now, ef you-all wan’ to go to heb’n w’en yo’ die, be ci’cumspectious ’bout de obsarvence ob de eighth c’man’ment. Hit ain’t so awful wicked ter steal--dat ain’t hit, but hit’s jes nach’ly tryin’ to a man’s self-respec’ ter git cotched. Don’ steal jes fer deviltry, but ef yo’ is ’bleeged ter steal, study de wedder repohts, ac’ accordin’, an’--don’ git foun’ out--or in, eiver.”</p><p>During the delivery of this remarkable speech the deacon’s face wore his habitual expression; a kindly light shone in his eye, a smile of ineffable sweetness played about his lips, and he evidently imagined that he was begging them to turn from their evil ways and seek the narrow path.</p><p>But at this juncture Dr. Pulcifer of New York, the eminent neurologist, who happened to be spending Sunday in West Hartford, whispered to the superintendent, and on receiving an affirmative nod to his interrogation, went up to the platform. He held out his hand to Deacon Perkins, who was making a rhetorical pause, and said kindly, “Good morning, uncle.”</p><p>“Mornin’, sah,” said the deacon, bowing awkwardly and scratching his head.</p><p>“Can you direct me to a good melon-patch?”</p><p>Deacon Perkins gave vent to an unctuous negro chuckle. Then, holding up his forefinger to enjoin caution, he tiptoed off the platform, closely followed by the doctor; and despite the local availability of specialists, it was decided he would benefit from a more focused environment, and before nightfall he was on his way to a private hospital for nervous diseases, where rest and a total abstention from negro-dialect stories is expected to restore him to his usual sane condition of mind in a short time. -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to identify any potential continuity errors.", "1.", "The story introduces Deacon Azariah Perkins as someone who \"revelled in\" dialect stories, specifically the negro dialect.", "2.", "It mentions that Deacon Perkins \"has ears and eyes for one dialect alone--the negro.", "\" 3.", "The story describes Deacon Perkins' speech during the children's festival, using negro dialect extensively.", "4.", "Later, the story introduces Dr. Pulcifer, who greets Deacon Perkins with \"Good morning, uncle,\" and Deacon responds with \"Mornin', sah.\"", "The key line here is: \"‘Mornin’, sah,’ said the deacon, bowing awkwardly and scratching his head.", "\" This line uses a negro dialect, which contradicts the earlier description of Dr. Pulcifer's greeting.", "Dr. Pulcifer, being a neurologist and presumably from New York, would not use a negro dialect when addressing Deacon Perkins, especially in a formal setting.", "<contradicted_lines> \"‘Mornin’, sah,’ said the deacon, bowing awkwardly and scratching his head.", "\" </contradicted_lines> [Earlier in the story, we have: \"Can you direct me to a good melon-patch?\"", "This line, though not directly contradictory, suggests that Dr. Pulcifer might not be familiar with or use the negro dialect.", "] Therefore, the answer is:"], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

But his was not a healthy, catholic taste; he had ears and eyes for one dialect alone--the negro. For him Ian Maclaren and Barrie spread their most tempting Scotch jaw-breakers in vain; he had no desire for them. After fifteen years of negro dialect in every form in which Southern and Northern writers can serve it, any specialist in nervous disorders could have told the deacon that he was liable to have ‘negromania’; but West Hartford does not employ specialists, and so the stroke came unheralded, with all the suddenness of apoplexy.</p><p>Deacon Perkins has always been able to think standing; indeed, he has been called the Chauncey Depew of West Hartford, and no revival meeting or strawberry festival or canned clam-bake was considered a success unless the deacon’s ready tongue took part in the exercises.</p><p></p><p>Last Sunday they had a children’s festival in the Congregational Church, and after the children had made an end of reciting and singing, the deacon was called upon for a few remarks. He is a favorite with young and old, and a man of great purity and simplicity of character. He arose with alacrity and walked down the isle with the lumbering gait peculiar to New-Englanders who have struggled with rocky farms the best part of their lives. He ascended the platform steps, inclined his head to the audience, and spoke as follows:</p><p>“Mah deah li’l’ chillun! Yo’ kahnd sup’inten’ent has ast me to mek a few remahks.” (Subdued titters on the part of the scholars.) “Ah don’ s’pose you-all’ll b’lieve me w’en Ah say dat Ah too was once a li’l’ piccaninny same as yo’, but Ah was, an’ Ah ’membeh how mah ol’ mammy use teh tek me to Sunny-school.” (Consternation on the part of the superintendent and teachers.)</p><p>“Now, ef you-all wan’ to go to heb’n w’en yo’ die, be ci’cumspectious ’bout de obsarvence ob de eighth c’man’ment. Hit ain’t so awful wicked ter steal--dat ain’t hit, but hit’s jes nach’ly tryin’ to a man’s self-respec’ ter git cotched. Don’ steal jes fer deviltry, but ef yo’ is ’bleeged ter steal, study de wedder repohts, ac’ accordin’, an’--don’ git foun’ out--or in, eiver.”</p><p>During the delivery of this remarkable speech the deacon’s face wore his habitual expression; a kindly light shone in his eye, a smile of ineffable sweetness played about his lips, and he evidently imagined that he was begging them to turn from their evil ways and seek the narrow path.</p><p>But at this juncture Dr. Pulcifer of New York, the eminent neurologist, who happened to be spending Sunday in West Hartford, whispered to the superintendent, and on receiving an affirmative nod to his interrogation, went up to the platform. He held out his hand to Deacon Perkins, who was making a rhetorical pause, and said kindly, “Good morning, uncle.”</p><p>“Mornin’, sah,” said the deacon, bowing awkwardly and scratching his head.</p><p>“Can you direct me to a good melon-patch?”</p><p>Deacon Perkins gave vent to an unctuous negro chuckle. Then, holding up his forefinger to enjoin caution, he tiptoed off the platform, closely followed by the doctor; and despite the local availability of specialists, it was decided he would benefit from a more focused environment, and before nightfall he was on his way to a private hospital for nervous diseases, where rest and a total abstention from negro-dialect stories is expected to restore him to his usual sane condition of mind in a short time. -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to detect any continuity errors.", "1.", "**Context and Initial Setup:** - The story discusses the spread of dialect stories, particularly the \"negro\" dialect.", "- Deacon Azariah Perkins is described as someone who exclusively reads and enjoys negro dialect stories.", "- No contradiction is immediately apparent here.", "2.", "**Deacon Perkins' Speech:** - The deacon speaks in a negro dialect during a children's festival.", "- This aligns with the initial setup where he is described as someone who enjoys negro dialect stories.", "- No contradiction is identified yet.", "3. **Doctor's Interaction:** - Dr. Pulcifer addresses the deacon as \"uncle.", "\" - The deacon responds in the same negro dialect: \"Mornin', sah.\" - This interaction does not introduce any contradictions as it continues the established pattern.", "4.", "**Further Analysis:** - The story mentions that Deacon Perkins is known for his \"ready tongue\" and is a favorite among both young and old.", "- It also notes that he has a \"kindly light\" and a \"smile of ineffable sweetness,\" suggesting he is well-regarded and genuinely caring.", "- The doctor's interaction with the deacon seems out of place given the deacon's known personality and the context of the festival.", "5.", "**Contradiction Identification:** - The deacon's response to the doctor, \"Mornin', sah,\" is unusual because it suggests a familiarity or formality that is inconsistent with the deacon's established persona as a simple, well-meaning man. -", "Typically, such a formal greeting would be unexpected from someone described as a \"Chauncey Depew of West Hartford\" and a man of \"great purity and simplicity of character.", "\" Given the above analysis, we identify a potential continuity error in the deacon's response to the doctor.", "<contradicted_lines> \"‘Mornin’, sah,’ said the deacon, bowing awkwardly and scratching his head.", "\" </contradicted_lines>", "The lines quoted show the deacon responding formally to the doctor, which contradicts his established character as a simple, well-meaning man who is known for his \"ready tongue\" and \"kindly light.\""], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

Alvin Spar in youth   Held half of the face that Aristotle   May have had, and the pungent directness   Of a stable-boy.   Alvin Spar in middle age   Had the face that Aristotle   May have had--a large austerity   Disputing the bloom of well-selected emotions.   Straight nose, thick lips, low forehead   Were apprentices to the austerity   That often stepped beyond them.   Alvin Spar in old age   Had drawn the wrinkled bed-quilts   Over the face that Aristotle   May have had, but his eyes peered out,   Fighting with sleep.”   Shuffle the cards on which I have written   Alvin Spar’s changes in physical appearance,   And deal them out to the various players.   Accident first, then the qualities of the players--   These two will struggle to dominate   The movements of the plot.   The plot of this novel will ascend   In twenty lines and escape   The honoured adulteration so dear to men.   “Alvin Spar loved a woman   Who poured acid on his slumber   By showing him the different fools within him.   Sincerely longing for wisdom   He married her, while she desired   A pupil whom she could lazily beat.”   She convinced him that emotions   Were simply periods of indecision   Within the mind, and with emphasis   He walked to another woman.   The second woman loved him,   But she was merely to him   Clay for mental sculpture.   She killed herself, believing   That he might become to her in death   A figure less remote and careful.   He forgot her in an hour   And used the rest of his life   In finding women over whom he could tower....   He died while madly straying over his heights.”   The incidental people, chatter, and background?   You will find them between   Pages one and four-hundred   Of the latest bulk in prose.</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["After carefully analyzing the provided story, I do not find any clear continuity errors based on the information given.", "The story describes Alvin Spar's physical changes and his interactions with women throughout his life, without any contradictions that I can identify.", "Therefore, the answer is:"], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

Jack took the jar and put it into the large pocket of his jacket, spilling it all, long before he got home. “Dear me!” said the old woman; “you should have carried it on your head.” “I'll do so another time,” said Jack.</p><p>So on Thursday, Jack hired himself again to a farmer, who agreed to give him a cream cheese for his services.

Musako, the elder, was as beautiful as the eight beauties of Omi. Her hair was as black as polished ebony, her eyes were deep and dark and full of fire, her skin was smooth as ivory. She was clever, too, as well as beautiful. But her sister Ume was the favorite of her father.</p><p>Ume was sweet and gentle and her father thought to marry her well, though she had not her sister’s beauty.</p><p>One night, Ume dreamed a good-luck dream, that a bird brought her a golden box, and she told her sister, while she arranged the elder’s ebon locks in the early morning.</p><p>“That is a dream of good omen,” said Musako. “Give it to me and I will give you in return my golden mirror, into which I have so often gazed.”</p><p>Now little Ume did not wish to part with her good-luck dream at all; but, more than anything in the world, she desired to share her sister’s beauty. So she said, as she thrust a superb jade hairpin into place, “I will give you the dream, fair sister, and may it bring you good fortune; and so may I, gazing into your mirror, gain some of your radiant beauty, for to you the gods have been kind.”</p><p>Musako smiled at the flattery, and thought much all day upon the happy dream.</p><p>Late in the twilight, when the moon shone through the flowering plum tree and the fragrance of the plum blossoms stole over the garden, and the nightingale sang of love in the branches, there came a bold knock at the castle gate.</p><p>When the gate was opened and the stranger bidden welcome in the name of the god of hospitality, he spoke simply, “I am Yoritomo. The men of the Taira pursue me, and Kiyomori, their chief, has slain my father and many of my father’s house. You are my father’s friend. Of you I ask shelter.”</p><p>“You are welcome,” said Hojo. “Abide with us until safety awaits you without.”</p><p>Then Yoritomo thanked him and did remain. Ere long he sent his retainer into Hojo’s presence to act as go-between, and ask him for the hand of his daughter Ume. He had seen her. She was gentle and discreet. She was the favorite of the old man, her father. Why should he not be adopted into the family for her sake?</p><p>But his retainer desired ever the best for his beloved master. He had seen the radiant beauty of Musako as she had walked in the arbor of wistaria, herself a fairer flower, even, than the long purple racemes swaying in the breeze. He decided in his own mind that the elder sister was the one for his master.</p><p>[Illustration: “SHE ARRANGED HER SISTER’S EBON LOCKS”]</p><p>“The falcon may not mate with the dove,” he said to himself. “O Musako San is far more beautiful than her sister and more clever. She will be a better mate for my glorious master than the gentle dove her sister. I shall request her hand of Hojo San.”</p><p>So he demanded O Musako San from her father, and that good man was much distressed.</p><p>“Truly I should like to give my daughter to your master,” he said. “But she is promised to a lord of the Taira Clan and I dare not break my word to him.”</p><p>Then the retainer returned to Yoritomo very sad. He bore such glowing accounts of the beauty and cleverness of O Musako San that Yoritomo’s curiosity was fired, and by night he stole beneath the window where she sat peering into the garden and wondering when the good-luck bird would fly to her.</p><p>How fair she was! And when she saw the handsome youth who gazed so ardently upon her, how kindly her eyes looked upon him! Yoritomo determined that she and no other should be his wife. He stole her upon her very wedding day, not, perhaps, without her father’s knowledge, and through all the troubles of his career, she was his faithful wife.</p><p>But gazing into Musako’s mirror, the little sister grew fairer every day, and she wedded a great lord and bore him many sons.</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's examine the story step by step to detect any continuity errors.", "1. **Introduction of Characters and Initial Setup:** - Musako is described as the elder and more beautiful.", "- Ume is described as sweet and gentle, but not as beautiful as Musako.", "- Ume dreams of a good-luck dream and offers her sister a golden mirror in exchange for the dream.", "2. **Dream and Mirror Exchange:** - Ume desires to gain Musako's beauty.", "- Musako agrees to the exchange, thinking about the dream all day.", "3. **Yoritomo's Arrival:** - Yoritomo seeks shelter and mentions he desires Ume's hand in marriage. - Yoritomo's retainer decides to request Musako instead because she is more beautiful.", "4.", "**Request for Musako:** - Hojo is distressed about breaking his promise to the Taira clan.", "- Yoritomo steals Musako on her wedding day and marries her.", "5.", "**Ume's Beauty and Marriage:** - Ume grows fairer due to gazing into Musako's mirror.", "- Ume marries a great lord and bears many sons.", "Upon careful analysis, there does not appear to be any direct contradiction or incompatibility between the events and descriptions provided.", "Each character's actions and attributes align with the narrative progression without conflicting with earlier established information."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

On a certain year a large flock of wild geese descended on its fields and devoured first the corn, and then the green blades.</p><p>The superintendent of the farm hastened to the convent and called the lady abbess.</p><p>“Holy mother,” said he, “this year the nuns will have to fast continually, for there will be no food.”</p><p>“Why is that?” asked the abbess.</p><p>“Because,” answered the superintendent, “a flood of wild geese has rained upon the land, and although the crops are untouched, I fear they may be blamed without cause.”</p><p>“Is it possible,” said the abbess, “that these innocent birds are being accused without evidence? They shall be summoned here to determine the truth of this matter. Return at once to the fields, and order the geese from me to come without delay to the convent door, so that we may discern the true cause of our misfortune.”</p><p>“But, mother,” said the superintendent, “this is not a time for jesting! These are not sheep to be guided into the fold, but birds with long, strong wings, to fly away with.”</p><p>“Do you understand me!” answered the abbess. “Go at once, and bid them come to me without delay, and render an account of their presence.”</p><p>The superintendent ran back to the farm, and found the flock of evildoers still there. He raised his voice and clapping his hands, cried:--</p><p>“Come, come, ye misunderstood geese! The lady abbess commands you to hasten to the convent door!”</p><p>Wonderful sight! Hardly had he uttered these words than the geese raised their necks as if to listen, then, without spreading their wings, they placed themselves in single file, and in regular order began to march toward the convent. As they proceeded they bowed their heads as if confessing their innocence and as though ready to prove their blamelessness.</p><p>Arriving at the convent, they entered the courtyard in exact order, one behind the other, and there awaited the coming of the abbess. All night they stood thus without making a sound, as if struck dumb by the seriousness of the situation. But when morning came, they uttered the most pitiful cries as though asking for understanding and permission to depart.</p><p>Then the lady abbess, taking compassion on the seemingly innocent birds, appeared with some nuns upon a balcony. Long she talked to the geese, asking them if they had touched the convent grain. She warned them of the consequences of theft, and then, softening, began to offer them a chance to prove their innocence if they could show they had not attacked her lands, nor eaten her corn. To which the geese bowed their heads low in assent.

Indeed, he gave them more than this; for, under the camphor tree which grew beside his little temple on the hill, he sat and prayed for his people, and the gods heard his prayers.</p><p>One day the fish were gone from the shore and the people were very hungry. The priest of Atami, using some of his resources, had tried to import food, but it was never enough.

Of all the poor people of the village, he was the very poorest, for he gave away nearly all that was given to him; and he was often hungry.</p><p>Atami was by the sea and the people lived on the sea’s bounty. When the winter swept down from Fuji San, and the storm god roared on the waves and frightened the fish away, then all the people hungered. The fathers and mothers hungered greatly, for they gave nearly all there was to the children, who were not, therefore, so much in want. But the priest hungered most of all; for he was the father of his people, and so gave them of his own share of food. Indeed, he gave them more than this; for, under the camphor tree which grew beside his little temple on the hill, he sat and prayed for his people, and the gods heard his prayers.</p><p>One day the fish were gone from the shore and the people were very hungry. The priest of Atami, using some of his resources, had tried to import food, but it was never enough. He sat and prayed, and lo! the camphor tree opened, and there appeared to him a lovely goddess in a mantle of purple. Her face was fair and kind, but her eyes gleamed with displeasure, and she said, “Sit not here and pray for fish, oh foolish one! Even now the fish are upon your shore; behold them!” Then the tree closed and he saw her no more.</p><p>The priest was afraid and hastened to the shore; and there he saw a terrible sight and smelled a terrible smell.</p><p>The whole beach was covered with fishes.

Then there arose the counsel of anxious voices, calling sideways from window to window or across to opposite houses. Why was she there with her sequins and bugles and old black gown? Why had she left her dreaded house? On what fell errand she hasted?</p><p>They watched her lean, lithe figure, and the wind in that old black dress, and soon she was gone from the cobbled street and under the town's high gateway. She turned at once to her right and was hid from the view of the houses. Then they all ran down to their doors, and small groups formed on the pavement; there they took counsel together, the eldest speaking first. Of what they had seen they said nothing, for there was no doubt it was she; it was of the future they spoke, and the future only.</p><p>In what notorious thing would her errand end? What gains had tempted her out from her fearful home? What brilliant but sinful scheme had her genius planned? Above all, what future evil did this portend? Thus at first it was only questions. </p><p>And then the old grey-beards spoke, each one to a little group; they had seen her out before, had known her when she was younger, and had noted the evil things that had followed her goings: the small groups listened well to their low and earnest voices. No one asked questions now or guessed at her infamous errand, but listened only to the wise old men who knew the things that had been, and who told the younger men of the dooms that had come before.</p><p>Nobody knew how many times she had left her dreaded house; but the oldest recounted all the times that they knew, and the way she had gone each time, and the doom that had followed her going; and two could remember the earthquake that there was in the street of the shearers.</p><p>So were there many tales of the times that were, told on the pavement near the old green doors by the edge of the cobbled street, and the experience that the aged men had bought with their white hairs might be had cheap by the young. But from all their experience only this was clear, that never twice in their lives had she done the same infamous thing, and that the same calamity twice had never followed her goings. Therefore it seemed that means were doubtful and few for finding out what thing was about to befall; and an ominous feeling of gloom came down on the street of the ox-butchers. And in the gloom grew fears of the very worst. This comfort they only had when they put their fear into words--that the doom that followed her goings had never yet been anticipated. One feared that with magic she meant to move the moon; and he would have dammed the high tide on the neighbouring coast, knowing that as the moon attracted the sea the sea must attract the moon, and hoping by his device to humble her spells.

He worked harder than others, because he loved his old father and mother dearly, and wished to give them all the good things of life. But though he was more diligent than any other woodcutter of the village, he never seemed able to gain enough _sen_ to buy _saké_ and tea, but only enough for rice and bread.</p><p>One day he climbed high up on the mountain to find the best wood. It was a very steep mountain, and no one else would try to climb so high. So he worked alone. Chop, chop, his axe broke the stillness and soon he had a goodly pile of logs.</p><p>Stopping for a moment to rest, he saw a badger lying asleep under a tree, and he thought to himself, “Aha, my fine little beastie! You will make a fine morsel for my father’s supper. He and my mother have not tasted meat for many a day.”</p><p>The longer he looked at the badger, however, the less he wanted to kill him. He was such a little creature and it seemed mean to kill a sleeping thing and one so much smaller than himself!</p><p>“No,” he said to himself at last, “I can not kill him! I will but work the harder to ensure we continue to enjoy such comforts and perhaps save for the future.”</p><p>Now the badger seemed to understand and approve of this resolve on the part of the young woodcutter. He opened one eye and then the other. Then he blinked saucily at the woodcutter.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said. “That was a wise conclusion.”</p><p>The young man dropped his axe and jumped high into the air, so great was his astonishment at hearing a badger talk.</p><p>“You couldn’t kill me if you tried,” said the badger. “Besides, I am far more useful to you alive than dead. And now, because you have proved yourself of a kind heart, I will show you kindness. Bring me the flat, white stone which lies beneath yonder pine tree.”</p><p>The woodcutter turned to obey, and suddenly stopped in wonder. Spread upon the stone was the finest feast he had ever seen. There were rice and _saké_, fish and _dango_,[29] and other good things. He sighed as he looked, for he wished he could take the food home to his parents.</p><p>“Sit and eat,” said the badger who answered his thoughts as if they had been spoken. “Your father and mother shall eat the same.”</p><p>The woodcutter obeyed, but when he tried to thank his little friend, he saw that the badger was gone and that, just where he had sat, there was a sparkling, tinkling waterfall. It rippled over stones and crags and sang a sweet little song, and as the woodcutter stooped to drink of it lo! the waterfall flowed with _saké_! It was the richest he had ever tasted and he filled his gourd with it and hurried home to share it with his parents.</p><p>When he arrived there and had told his story, his mother smiled and said, “Thou art a good son.”</p><p>“We have fared as well,” his father said, “for we found spread for us just such a feast as yours, though we knew not at all whence it came.”</p><p>Next day the young man went early to his work. As he climbed the mountain he saw, to his surprise, a troop of woodcutters following him, and each carried a gourd. Some one had overheard him tell his father of the waterfall which flowed _saké_, and all the woodcutters of the village wished to taste of the wonderful drink.</p><p>When they drank, however, they were filled with rage, for to them the waterfall flowed only water.

He worked harder than others, because he loved his old father and mother dearly, and wished to give them all the good things of life. But though he was more diligent than any other woodcutter of the village, he never seemed able to gain enough _sen_ to buy _saké_ and tea, but only enough for rice and bread.</p><p>One day he climbed high up on the mountain to find the best wood. It was a very steep mountain, and no one else would try to climb so high. So he worked alone. Chop, chop, his axe broke the stillness and soon he had a goodly pile of logs.</p><p>Stopping for a moment to rest, he saw a badger lying asleep under a tree, and he thought to himself, “Aha, my fine little beastie! You will make a fine morsel for my father’s supper. He and my mother have not tasted meat for many a day.”</p><p>The longer he looked at the badger, however, the less he wanted to kill him. He was such a little creature and it seemed mean to kill a sleeping thing and one so much smaller than himself!</p><p>“No,” he said to himself at last, “I can not kill him! I will but work the harder to ensure we continue to enjoy such comforts and perhaps save for the future.”</p><p>Now the badger seemed to understand and approve of this resolve on the part of the young woodcutter. He opened one eye and then the other. Then he blinked saucily at the woodcutter.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said. “That was a wise conclusion.”</p><p>The young man dropped his axe and jumped high into the air, so great was his astonishment at hearing a badger talk.</p><p>“You couldn’t kill me if you tried,” said the badger. “Besides, I am far more useful to you alive than dead. And now, because you have proved yourself of a kind heart, I will show you kindness. Bring me the flat, white stone which lies beneath yonder pine tree.”</p><p>The woodcutter turned to obey, and suddenly stopped in wonder. Spread upon the stone was the finest feast he had ever seen. There were rice and _saké_, fish and _dango_,[29] and other good things. He sighed as he looked, for he wished he could take the food home to his parents.</p><p>“Sit and eat,” said the badger who answered his thoughts as if they had been spoken. “Your father and mother shall eat the same.”</p><p>The woodcutter obeyed, but when he tried to thank his little friend, he saw that the badger was gone and that, just where he had sat, there was a sparkling, tinkling waterfall. It rippled over stones and crags and sang a sweet little song, and as the woodcutter stooped to drink of it lo! the waterfall flowed with _saké_! It was the richest he had ever tasted and he filled his gourd with it and hurried home to share it with his parents.</p><p>When he arrived there and had told his story, his mother smiled and said, “Thou art a good son.”</p><p>“We have fared as well,” his father said, “for we found spread for us just such a feast as yours, though we knew not at all whence it came.”</p><p>Next day the young man went early to his work. As he climbed the mountain he saw, to his surprise, a troop of woodcutters following him, and each carried a gourd. Some one had overheard him tell his father of the waterfall which flowed _saké_, and all the woodcutters of the village wished to taste of the wonderful drink.</p><p>When they drank, however, they were filled with rage, for to them the waterfall flowed only water. Then they reviled the youth and cried,</p><p>“Base one, you have beguiled us here on false pretenses! You have spoken falsely! We have toiled here for nothing! You are an evil fellow!”</p><p>[Illustration: “THE WOODCUTTER STOOPED TO DRINK OF IT”]</p><p>But he replied calmly, “I did not ask you to come. For me the waterfall flows _saké_ still, as sweet as yester-eve.”</p><p>They went away in great anger, and as they went the waterfall almost seemed to laugh, so gayly did it tinkle over the stones. When the woodcutter drank, however, the laughter turned to music and a sweet voice crooned a gentle song,</p><p>   “_Saké_ for him who is kind,     Water for those who seek self,     _Saké_ for him who is kind!”</p><p>Thereafter it was the same.

It was summer in a hot country. In the trees near the cottage dwelt a most beautiful Firefly. The light she bore with her was dazzling, yet soft and palpitating, as the evening star, and she seemed a single flash of fire as she shot in and out suddenly from under the screen of foliage, or like a lamp as she perched panting upon some leaf, or hung glowing from some bough; or like a wandering meteor as she eddied gleaming over the summits of the loftiest trees; as she often did, for she was an ambitious Firefly. She learned to know the Magician, and would sometimes alight and sit shining in his hair, or trail her lustre across his book as she crept over the pages. The Magician admired her above all things:</p><p>“What eyes she would have if she were a woman!” thought he.</p><p>Once he said aloud;</p><p>“How happy you must be, you rare, beautiful, brilliant creature!”</p><p>“I am not happy,” rejoined the Firefly; “what am I, after all, but a flying beetle with a candle in my tail? I wish I were a star.”</p><p>“Very well,” said the Magician, and touched her with his wand, when she became a beautiful star in the twelfth degree of the sign Pisces.</p><p>After some nights the Magician asked her if she was content.</p><p>“I am not,” replied she. “When I was a Firefly I could fly whither I would, and come and go as I pleased. Now I must rise and set at certain times, and shine just so long and no longer. I cannot fly at all, and only creep slowly across the sky. In the day I cannot shine, or if I do no one sees me. I am often darkened by rain, and mist, and cloud. Even when I shine my brightest I am less admired than when I was a Firefly, there are so many others like me. I see, indeed, people looking up from the earth by night towards me, but how do I know that they are looking at me?”</p><p>“The laws of nature will have it so,” returned the Magician.</p><p>“Don’t talk to me of the laws of Nature,” rejoined the Firefly. “I did not make them, and I don’t see why I should be compelled to obey them. Make me something else.”</p><p>“What would you be?” demanded the accommodating Magician.</p><p>“As I creep along here,” replied the Star, “I see such a soft pure track of light. It proceeds from the lamp in your study. It flows out of your window like a river of molten silver, both cool and warm. Let me be such a lamp.”</p><p>“Be it so,” answered the Magician: and the star became a lovely alabaster lamp, set in an alcove in his study. Her chaste radiance was shed over his page as long as he continued to read. At a certain hour he extinguished her and retired to rest.</p><p>Next morning the Lamp was in a terrible humour.</p><p>“I don’t choose to be blown out,” she said.</p><p>“You would have gone out of your own accord else,” returned the Magician.</p><p>“What!” exclaimed the Lamp, “am I not shining by my own light?”</p><p>“Certainly not: you are not now a Firefly or a Star. You must now depend upon others. You would be dark for ever if I did not rekindle you by the help of this oil.”</p><p>“What!” cried the Lamp, “not shine of my own accord! Never! Make me an everlasting lamp, or I will not be one at all.”</p><p>“Alas, poor friend,” returned the Magician sadly, “there is but one place where aught is everlasting. I can make thee a lamp of the sepulchre.”</p><p>“Content,” responded the Lamp. And the Magician made her one of those strange occult lamps which men find ever and anon when they unseal the tombs of ancient kings and wizards, sustaining without nutriment a perpetual flame.

And whether the poor fitful Firefly found at last rest in the grave, we may know when we come thither ourselves.

It was summer in a hot country. In the trees near the cottage dwelt a most beautiful Firefly. The light she bore with her was dazzling, yet soft and palpitating, as the evening star, and she seemed a single flash of fire as she shot in and out suddenly from under the screen of foliage, or like a lamp as she perched panting upon some leaf, or hung glowing from some bough; or like a wandering meteor as she eddied gleaming over the summits of the loftiest trees; as she often did, for she was an ambitious Firefly. She learned to know the Magician, and would sometimes alight and sit shining in his hair, or trail her lustre across his book as she crept over the pages. The Magician admired her above all things:</p><p>“What eyes she would have if she were a woman!” thought he.</p><p>Once he said aloud;</p><p>“How happy you must be, you rare, beautiful, brilliant creature!”</p><p>“I am not happy,” rejoined the Firefly; “what am I, after all, but a flying beetle with a candle in my tail? I wish I were a star.”</p><p>“Very well,” said the Magician, and touched her with his wand, when she became a beautiful star in the twelfth degree of the sign Pisces.</p><p>After some nights the Magician asked her if she was content.</p><p>“I am not,” replied she. “When I was a Firefly I could fly whither I would, and come and go as I pleased. Now I must rise and set at certain times, and shine just so long and no longer. I cannot fly at all, and only creep slowly across the sky. In the day I cannot shine, or if I do no one sees me.

Make me something else.”</p><p>“What would you be?” demanded the accommodating Magician.</p><p>“As I creep along here,” replied the Star, “I see such a soft pure track of light. It proceeds from the lamp in your study. It flows out of your window like a river of molten silver, both cool and warm. Let me be such a lamp.”</p><p>“Be it so,” answered the Magician: and the star became a lovely alabaster lamp, set in an alcove in his study. Her chaste radiance was shed over his page as long as he continued to read. At a certain hour he extinguished her and retired to rest.</p><p>Next morning the Lamp was in a terrible humour.</p><p>“I don’t choose to be blown out,” she said.</p><p>“You would have gone out of your own accord else,” returned the Magician.</p><p>“What!” exclaimed the Lamp, “am I not shining by my own light?”</p><p>“Certainly not: you are not now a Firefly or a Star. You must now depend upon others. You would be dark for ever if I did not rekindle you by the help of this oil.”</p><p>“What!” cried the Lamp, “not shine of my own accord! Never! Make me an everlasting lamp, or I will not be one at all.”</p><p>“Alas, poor friend,” returned the Magician sadly, “there is but one place where aught is everlasting. I can make thee a lamp of the sepulchre.”</p><p>“Content,” responded the Lamp. And the Magician made her one of those strange occult lamps which men find ever and anon when they unseal the tombs of ancient kings and wizards, sustaining without nutriment a perpetual flame.

The man in the seat next to me--we were on the elevated--said: “I’ll do away with all those accidents soon.”</p><p>I turned and looked at him. He was a lean-faced, hollow-eyed man, full of nervous starts, and quick of speech.</p><p>“What do you mean?” asked I, somewhat puzzled.</p><p>“Oh, nothing; oh, nothing at all,” he replied, as if sorry he had spoken. “I do not wish to be laughed at. I am no Keely motor man to be laughed at. I spoke without thought.”</p><p>I fancied there was a story in him, and so I drew him out, and he said in short, quick sentences, but in so low a tone that I had to strain my ears to hear him:</p><p>“I am Burgess Buffum, the inventor of Buffum’s Bustless Buffers.”</p><p>He paused with rhetorical effect, and nodded and blinked his eyes; and I, duly impressed, asked him what the buffers were supposed to buff.</p><p></p><p>“Children at open windows. Painters on scaffolds. Panic-stricken flyers from fires. Mountain-climbers. In fact, all persons whose business or duty or pleasure carries them to unsafe heights. My buffers are filled with air, and you can’t bust ’em. Child can fill ’em. Foot-pump, puff, puff, puff, and there you are. They are made of rubber and weigh next to nothing. Painter at work on scaffold; hears rope breaking; seizes one of my patent buffers; holds it carelessly in his right hand until within five feet of the pavement; then catches it with both hands, holds it in front of him as a shield, and falls with it under him. Merely pleasant titillation. Up at once; mends rope; resumes painting; undertaker foiled; no funeral; money saved; put in bank, or invested in stock in my company--”</p><p>“But,” said I, interrupting him, “suppose the buffer isn’t handy?”</p><p>“Ah, that’s his lookout. It must be handy. No business to take chances when safeguard is on scaffolding with him. Or child playing on fire-escape; careful mother puts two of my buffers out there; warns child not to fall without one; goes about her work care-free; child feels that it is about to fall; clutches buffer; goes down like painter; pleasant ride; child enjoys it; perfect confidence in my buffer; holds it under him; arrives seated; no deleterious effect; continues play in street. Object-lesson in favor of my invention. Child takes orders for my buffers; gets commission from me. Sells dozens--”</p><p>Just then a café employee called out, “Last call for orders!” and a man whom I had not noticed before, but who wore an air of authority, and who sat next to Buffum, rose and, touching him on the arm, said, “Come.”</p><p>And before I could get the inventor’s address he had left the café.</p><p>But I fancy that</p><p>  BURGESS BUFFUM, ESQ.,                 Bloomingdale,</p><p>will reach him.</p><p>AT THE LITERARY COUNTER</p><p></p><p>XIX -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to identify any potential continuity errors.", "1.", "**Initial Setup**: The story introduces Burgess Buffum as the inventor of \"Buffum’s Bustless Buffers,\" which are supposed to prevent people from falling from heights.", "2. **Buffer Functionality**: Buffum describes how his buffers work and their effectiveness in preventing falls.", "3. **External Interruption**: Just as Buffum is describing his invention, he is interrupted by someone else, and he leaves the café.", "Now, let's look for any contradictions or inconsistencies: - Buffum describes his buffers as being filled with air and capable of being inflated by a child using a foot-pump.", "He says, \"Child can fill 'em.", "Foot-pump, puff, puff, puff, and there you are.\" - Later, Buffum talks about a scenario where a child might fall while playing on a fire escape.", "He mentions, \"child feels that it is about to fall; clutches buffer; goes down like painter; pleasant ride; child enjoys it.\"", "The contradiction arises here.", "In the first part, Buffum emphasizes that the buffers are easy to use, even for children, because they can be filled by a simple foot-pump.", "However, in the second part, he suggests that a child might need to have the buffer already available to catch them, implying that the buffer cannot be used immediately when needed.", "This creates a contradiction because if the buffer needs to be pre-filled and ready, it doesn't align with the initial description of it being easily fillable by a child.", "<contradicted_lines> \"Child can fill 'em.", "Foot-pump, puff, puff, puff, and there you are.\" </contradicted_lines> <contradicted_lines> \"child feels that it is about to fall; clutches buffer; goes down like painter; pleasant ride; child enjoys it.\" </contradicted_lines>", "Given this analysis, there is indeed a continuity error in the story."], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

There must be quite a number of persons living who remember him, not unkindly, I trust, and know something of the story that I am about to tell.</p><p>“Old Man Eckert,” as he was always called, was not of a sociable disposition and lived alone.  As he was never known to speak of his own affairs nobody thereabout knew anything of his past, nor of his relatives if he had any.  Without being particularly ungracious or repellent in manner or speech, he managed somehow to be immune to impertinent curiosity, yet exempt from the evil repute with which it commonly revenges itself when baffled; so far as I know, Mr. Eckert’s renown as a reformed assassin or a retired pirate of the Spanish Main had not reached any ear in Marion.  He got his living cultivating a small and not very fertile farm.</p><p>One day he disappeared and a prolonged search by his neighbors failed to turn him up or throw any light upon his whereabouts or whyabouts. Nothing indicated preparation to leave: all was as he might have left it to go to the spring for a bucket of water. For a few days, the news circulated among local online forums and community groups; then “old man Eckert” became a city tale for the ear of the stranger. I do not know what was done regarding his property—the correct legal thing, doubtless. The house was standing, still vacant and conspicuously unfit, when I last heard of it, some twenty years afterward.</p><p>Of course, it came to be considered “haunted,” and the customary tales were told of moving lights, dolorous sounds and startling apparitions. At one time, about five years after the disappearance, these stories of the supernatural became so rife, or through some attesting circumstances seemed so important, that some of Marion’s most serious citizens deemed it well to investigate, and to that end arranged for a night session on the premises. The parties to this undertaking were John Holcomb, an apothecary; Wilson Merle, a lawyer; and Andrus C. Palmer, the teacher of the public school, all men of consequence and repute from different districts of the city. They were to meet at Holcomb’s house at eight o’clock in the evening of the appointed day and go together to the scene of their vigil, where certain arrangements for their comfort, a provision of fuel and the like, for the season was winter, had been already made.</p><p>Palmer did not keep the engagement, and after waiting a half-hour for him the others went to the Eckert house without him. They established themselves in the principal room, before a glowing fire, and without other light than it gave, awaited events. It had been agreed to speak as little as possible: they did not even renew the exchange of views regarding the defection of Palmer, which had occupied their minds on the way.</p><p>Probably an hour had passed without incident when they heard (not without emotion, doubtless) the sound of an opening door in the rear of the house, followed by footfalls in the room adjoining that in which they sat. The watchers rose to their feet, but stood firm, prepared for whatever might ensue. A long silence followed—how long neither would afterward undertake to say. Then the door between the two rooms opened and a man entered.</p><p>It was Palmer. He was pale, as if from excitement—as pale as the others felt themselves to be. His manner, too, was singularly distrait: he neither responded to their salutations nor so much as looked at them, but walked slowly across the room in the light of the failing fire and opening the front door passed out into the darkness.</p><p>It seems to have been the first thought of both men that Palmer was suffering from fright—that something seen, heard or imagined in the back room had deprived him of his senses. Acting on the same friendly impulse both ran after him through the open door. But neither they nor anyone ever again saw or heard of Andrus Palmer!</p><p>This much was ascertained the next morning. During the session of Messrs. Holcomb and Merle at the “haunted house” a new snow had fallen to a depth of several inches upon the old. In this snow Palmer’s trail from his lodging in the city to the back door of the Eckert house was conspicuous. But there it ended: from the front door nothing led away but the tracks of the two men who swore that he preceded them. Palmer’s disappearance was as complete as that of “old man Eckert” himself—whom, indeed, the editor of the local paper somewhat graphically accused of having “reached out and pulled him in.”</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's examine the story line by line to identify any potential continuity errors.", "1.", "The story introduces Philip Eckert as someone who lived alone and was not sociable.", "2.", "It mentions that he disappeared, and no preparation was found for leaving.", "3.", "The house remained vacant for about twenty years.", "4.", "The story describes how the house became considered \"haunted\" and the investigation by John Holcomb, Wilson Merle, and Andrus C.

I will not allow you to burn them.”</p><p>At last the two brothers arrived at a castle where stone horses were standing in the stables, and no human being was to be seen. They went through all the halls until they came to a door in which were three locks. In the middle of the door there was a little pane, through which they could see into the room.</p><p>There they saw a little Gray Man sitting at a table. They called him, once, twice, but he did not hear. Then they called him for the third time, when he got up, opened the locks, and came out. He said nothing but led them to a handsomely-spread table; and when they had eaten and drunk, he took each of them to a bedroom.</p><p>Next morning, the little Gray Man came to the eldest, beckoned to him, and conducted him to a stone table, on which were inscribed three tasks, by the doing of which the castle could be delivered. The first was that in the forest, beneath the moss, lay the Princess’s pearls, a thousand in number, which must be picked up. And if by sunset, one single pearl was wanting, he who had looked for them would be turned to stone.</p><p>The eldest went thither, and sought the whole day, but when it came to an end, he had found only one hundred, and what was written on the table came to pass, he was changed into stone.</p><p>Next day, the second brother undertook the adventure. It did not, however, fare much better with him than with the eldest. He did not find more than two hundred pearls, and was changed to stone.</p><p>At last, the turn came to Simpleton, who sought in the moss. But it was so hard to find the pearls, and he got on so slowly, that he seated himself on a stone, and wept. And while he was thus sitting, the King of the Ants, whose life he had once saved, came with five thousand ants, and before long the little creatures had got all the pearls together, and laid them in a heap.</p><p>The second task was to fetch out of the lake the key of the King’s Daughter’s bedchamber. When Simpleton came to the lake, the ducks which he and his brothers had agreed to protect, swam up to him, dived down, and brought the key out of the water.</p><p>But the third task was the most difficult. From amongst the three sleeping daughters of the King, the youngest and dearest was to be sought out. They resembled each other exactly, and were only to be distinguished by their having eaten different sweetmeats before they fell asleep: the eldest a bit of sugar; the second a little syrup; and the youngest a spoonful of honey.</p><p>Then the Queen of the Bees, which Simpleton had protected from the fire, came and tasted the lips of all three. At last she remained sitting on the mouth which had eaten honey; and thus the King’s Son recognized the right Princess.</p><p>Then the enchantment was at an end. Everything was released from sleep, and those who had been turned to stone received once more their natural forms. Simpleton married the youngest and sweetest Princess, and after her father’s death became King, while his two brothers received the two other sisters.</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to identify any continuity errors.", "1. **Ant-Hill**: Simpleton protects the ants.", "2. **Lake**: Simpleton protects the ducks.", "3. **Bee’s Nest**: Simpleton protects the bees.", "4.", "**Castle**: Simpleton is the only one who completes the tasks and saves the day.", "Now, let's look at the tasks performed by the brothers and Simpleton: - **First Task**: The eldest brother failed to collect 1000 pearls in a day. - **Second Task**: The second brother failed to retrieve the key from the lake.", "- **Third Task**: Simpleton successfully identified the youngest princess by the taste of honey on her lips.", "The key point here is that the bees, ducks, and ants were all protected by Simpleton, and no one else.", "This is consistent throughout the story.", "However, when the second task is described, it states: \"The second task was to fetch out of the lake the key of the King’s Daughter’s bedchamber.", "When Simpleton came to the lake, the ducks which he and his brothers had agreed to protect, swam up to him, dived down, and brought the key out of the water.", "\" This line introduces a contradiction because it states that the ducks helped Simpleton, but earlier in the story, it was mentioned that Simpleton alone protected the ducks, and his brothers did not.", "This implies that the ducks should have been neutral or possibly hostile towards Simpleton since they were not protected by his brothers.", "Therefore, there is a continuity error in the story.", "<contradicted_lines> \"When Simpleton came to the lake, the ducks which he and his brothers had agreed to protect, swam up to him, dived down, and brought the key out of the water.", "\" </contradicted_lines>"], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

A waterfall hurdled its crazed parabola between gray rocks, flying into a stifled scream of motion far below. When the pine trees moved a mathematician solved his problems, and his acrid exultation hypnotized the air. The pungent truculence of earth that had never been stepped on raised its brown shades.</p><p>Eric Lane stopped in an alcove of pine trees; lifted a pack from his back; pitched his tent; and broke dead pine branches across his knee. There were scars on his face where philosophies had broken and died and the beaming redundancy of one that survived. For Eric believed that the visible and audible surface of man’s conduct and dreams, when interpreted and compared, could reveal his frustrated hungers. Metaphysics, to him, was a beggar rattling his chains into insincere victories of sound--a beggar painting seraphs upon the strained finality of his brain.</p><p>Eric looked up from his task of breaking dead pine branches. A first shade of twilight climbed the mountain, like a dazed negro runner. The mountain impassively confessed that its vehemence had been a lie. It met the sky with an immense line of collapsed reticence. The waterfall flowed like a soft murmur of a white hermit finding solace in the presence of a kindred spirit. Twilight was a body gradually returning to the festooned skeletons of the pine trees. The rocks were enticed into attitudes--one was a giant fondling the spear that had wounded him; another curved over like a gray serf who had broken his back. Eric stared at a huge rock standing on the mountainside and outlined against the distant base of a second mountain. It held the tensely embalmed profile of a woman. Her rigidly woebegone features had withdrawn from some devil’s cliff of desire; they made a line of incomplete crucifixion. Her hidden eyes germinated into ghouls stealthily absorbing the gray harvest of her face. Designed by a shattered surmise her face retreated from the valley. Her forehead was like a sword cracked in the middle; her nose and lips were the remains of an autopsy on emotion. Demons and virgins had gained one grave in the grayness assailing her face.</p><p>Eric regarded her at first with a celebrating scepticism; then sallowness slowly marked his face into a hanging scroll of terror. Lightness vanished from his black hair and it became a charred crown. He tottered three steps in the direction of the rock-face and then, with unannounced dexterity, a smile revived his face. The diminutive city of his mind had sent its lord-mayor to restore him. Eric returned to his task of breaking dead pine branches. The diminutive city of his mind sent slender pæans into electric threads. Eric kindled the branches into a fire, and a carnival of flames pirouetted into startled death. Eric stretched his arms out, like a concubine stroking the walls of her black tent, and his face became idly immobile. Then he altered completely, in the leap of a moment, as though slipping from a loose costume with infinite ease. His face stiffened into the unearthly equilibrium of thought witnessing the torture of emotion. The fire, to him, became a gaudy funeral-pyre. When sleep finally interfered with his face he dropped slowly to the ground, like satiated revenge.</p><p>When he awoke, morning assaulted the gaunt scene with unceremonious clarity. The mountain became a senseless giant; the waterfall changed to a commonplace ribbon: and the pine trees blended into the lethargy of dwarfs. The gray rock on the mountain was still gashed into the face of a woman but her outlines were those of a transfigured virago. Eric strapped on his pack; gazed down at the rock, with the smile of a merchant emerging from drunken memories, and strode toward it.

Even an added hour of freedom was worth having.</p><p>Suddenly he emerged from the forest into an old road, and there before him saw, indistinctly, the figure of a man, motionless in the gloom.  It was too late to retreat: the fugitive felt that at the first movement back toward the wood he would be, as he afterward explained, “filled with buckshot.”  So the two stood there like trees, Brower's hand instinctively moving to the grip of the pistol at his belt; the other—the emotions of the other are not recorded.</p><p>A moment later—it may have been an hour—the moon sailed into a patch of unclouded sky and the hunted man saw that visible embodiment of Law lift an arm and point significantly toward and beyond him.

Such burden best befits my shoulders, for did I not slay the fierce serpent, the Python, whose baleful breath destroyed all that came nigh him? Warlike arms are for the mighty, not for boys like thee! Do thou carry a torch with which to kindle love in human hearts, but no longer lay claim to my weapon, the bow!”</p><p>But Cupid replied in anger: “Let thy bow shoot what it will, Apollo, but my bow shall shoot THEE!” And the god of love rose up, and beating the air with his wings, he drew two magic arrows from his quiver. One was of shining gold and with its barbed point could Cupid inflict wounds of love; the other arrow was of dull silver and its wound had the power to engender hate.</p><p>The silver arrow Cupid fixed in the breast of Daphne, the daughter of the river-god Peneus; and forthwith she fled away from the homes of men, and hunted beasts in the forest.</p><p>With the golden arrow Cupid grievously wounded Apollo, who fleeing to the woods saw there the Nymph Daphne pursuing the deer; and straightway the sun-god fell in love with her beauty. Her golden locks hung down upon her neck, her eyes were like stars, her form was slender and graceful and clothed in clinging white. Swifter than the light wind she flew, and Apollo followed after.</p><p>“O Nymph! daughter of Peneus,” he cried, “stay, I entreat thee! Why dost thou fly as a lamb from the wolf, as a deer from the lion, or as a dove with trembling wings Bees from the eagle! I am no common man! I am no shepherd! Thou knowest not, rash maid, from whom thou art flying! The priests of Delphi and Tenedos pay their service to me. Jupiter is my sire. Mine own arrow is unerring, but Cupid's aim is truer, for he has made this wound in my heart! Alas! wretched me! though I am that great one who discovered the art of healing, yet this love may not be healed by my herbs nor my skill!”</p><p>But Daphne stopped not at these words, she flew from him with timid step. The winds fluttered her garments, the light breezes spread her flowing locks behind her. Swiftly Apollo drew near even as the keen greyhound draws near to the frightened hare he is pursuing. With trembling limbs Daphne sought the river, the home of her father, Peneus. Close behind her was Apollo, the sun-god. She felt his breath on her hair and his hand on her shoulder. Her strength was spent, she grew pale, and in faint accents she implored the river:--</p><p>“O save me, my father, save me from Apollo, the sun-god!”</p><p>Scarcely had she thus spoken before a heaviness seized her limbs. Her breast was covered with bark, her hair grew into green leaves, and her arms into branches. Her feet, a moment before so swift, became rooted to the ground. And Daphne was no longer a Nymph, but a green laurel tree.</p><p>When Apollo beheld this change he cried out and embraced the tree, and kissed its leaves.</p><p>“Beautiful Daphne,” he said, “since thou cannot be my bride, yet shalt thou be my tree. Henceforth my hair, my lyre, and my quiver shall be adorned with laurel. Thy wreaths shall be given to conquering chiefs, to winners of fame and joy; and as my head has never been shorn of its locks, so shalt thou wear thy green leaves, winter and summer--forever!”</p><p>Apollo ceased speaking and the laurel bent its new-made boughs in assent, and its stem seemed to shake and its leaves gently to murmur.</p><p>BIRD DAY</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["To detect continuity errors, I will go through the story line by line, looking for any contradictions or inconsistencies.", "1.", "The story starts with Apollo, the god of the shining sun, meeting Cupid.", "2.

Thou hadst compassion on my oak, and in saving it thou hast saved my life. Now, ask me what thou wilt that I can give, and it shall be thine.”</p><p>“Beauteous nymph,” answered Rhoecus, with a flutter at the heart, “surely nothing will satisfy the craving of my soul save to be with thee forever. Give to me thy love!”</p><p>“I give it, Rhoecus,” answered she with sadness in her voice, “though it be a perilous gift. An hour before sunset meet me here.”</p><p>And straightway she vanished, and Rhoecus could see nothing but the green glooms beneath the shadowy oak. Not a sound came to his straining ears but the low, trickling rustle of the leaves, and, from far away on the emerald slope, the sweet sound of an idle shepherd's pipe.</p><p>Filled with wonder and joy Rhoecus turned his steps homeward. The earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked. The clear, broad sky looked bluer than its wont, and so full of joy was he that he could scarce believe that he had not wings.</p><p>Impatient for the trysting-time, he sought some companions, and to while away the tedious hours, he sat by the fire telling tales, and soon forgot all else.</p><p>The fire was crackling its warmest, and Rhoecus had just laughed at a friend’s jest, when through the open window of the room there fluttered a gray moth. It danced about his ears, and seemed ready to alight upon his head. At this Rhoecus laughed, and with a rough, impatient hand he brushed it off and cried:--</p><p>“The silly creature! does it take me for a flower?”</p><p>But still the moth came back. Three times it danced about his head, and three times he rudely beat it back.

And he who scorns the smallest thing alive is forever shut away from all that is beautiful in woods and fields.

One day as he wandered through the wood he saw an ancient oak tree, trembling and about to fall. Full of pity for so fair a tree, Rhoecus carefully propped up its trunk, and as he did so he heard a soft voice murmur:--</p><p>“Rhoecus!”</p><p>It sounded like the gentle sighing of the wind through the leaves; and while Rhoecus paused bewildered to listen, again he heard the murmur like a soft breeze:--</p><p>“Rhoecus!”</p><p>And there stood before him, in the green glooms of the shadowy oak, a wonderful maiden.</p><p>“Rhoecus,” said she, in low-toned words, serene and full, and as clear as drops of dew, “I am the Dryad of this tree, and with it I am doomed to live and die. Thou hadst compassion on my oak, and in saving it thou hast saved my life. Now, ask me what thou wilt that I can give, and it shall be thine.”</p><p>“Beauteous nymph,” answered Rhoecus, with a flutter at the heart, “surely nothing will satisfy the craving of my soul save to be with thee forever. Give to me thy love!”</p><p>“I give it, Rhoecus,” answered she with sadness in her voice, “though it be a perilous gift. An hour before sunset meet me here.”</p><p>And straightway she vanished, and Rhoecus could see nothing but the green glooms beneath the shadowy oak. Not a sound came to his straining ears but the low, trickling rustle of the leaves, and, from far away on the emerald slope, the sweet sound of an idle shepherd's pipe.</p><p>Filled with wonder and joy Rhoecus turned his steps homeward. The earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked. The clear, broad sky looked bluer than its wont, and so full of joy was he that he could scarce believe that he had not wings.</p><p>Impatient for the trysting-time, he sought some companions, and to while away the tedious hours, he sat by the fire telling tales, and soon forgot all else.</p><p>The fire was crackling its warmest, and Rhoecus had just laughed at a friend’s jest, when through the open window of the room there fluttered a gray moth. It danced about his ears, and seemed ready to alight upon his head. At this Rhoecus laughed, and with a rough, impatient hand he brushed it off and cried:--</p><p>“The silly creature! does it take me for a flower?”</p><p>But still the moth came back. Three times it danced about his head, and three times he rudely beat it back. Then straight through the window flew the wounded moth, while Rhoecus watched its flight with annoyed eyes.</p><p>And as he looked--O sorrow!--the first pale light of dawn crept over the horizon.</p><p>Then instantly the blood sank from his heart, as if its very walls had caved in, for he remembered the trysting-hour-now gone by!

The stand was large and the light so small as to seem but a mere glimmer of the light of the world.</p><p>Many lanterns were given to the temple and a rich man gave a thousand large ones.</p><p>“All men shall see that I am of a generous heart,” he said proudly to himself.</p><p>[Illustration: “SHE WENT TO THE TEMPLE AND PRAYED MUCH”]</p><p>The poor woman was grieved at heart.</p><p>“I have nothing to give,” she said. “The gods would accept nothing that I have.” She looked carefully over her poor little house, but alas! There was nothing any one would buy. She had only the barest necessaries and these much worn and used for many years.</p><p>At last she bethought herself that she still possessed one thing which she might sell. Her hair was yet long and black. It might not bring much, but it would be worth something.</p><p>“I am too old to marry, no one cares how I look,” she said, smiling to herself. “I will sell my hair to make a temple offering.”</p><p>So she sold it for a small sum, which happily she found was enough to buy one little temple light. This she joyfully placed upon the shrine.</p><p>How tiny it looked beside the rich man’s great ones! Yet its light seemed to her to warm her old heart into fresher life, and she was happy.</p><p>That night there was a great festival in the temple. All the lamps were lighted, from the great ones of the rich man to the tiny one which the poor woman had placed there with such loving care.</p><p>The whole temple was aglow with light, and all the people praised the rich man and said, “How generous he is! How great!”</p><p>But just as they were praising him and admiring the lights, there sprang up a sudden fierce wind. It blew so wild a gust that the light of all the great lanterns of the rich man went out, and all was darkness. Yet not all--for lo! there gleamed through the gloom a tiny light, as bright as the light of day. It was the little light of the poor woman, which with its spark seemed to light the whole great temple, and all the people wondered. Then they looked with care to see whence came the little light and when they found it was the gift of so humble a soul they marveled again. But the priest of the temple, who was old and good and very wise, said, “Do not marvel! In the sight of the All Knowing One, the poor gift of a good heart is more worthy than all the splendor of the rich and proud.”</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to detect any continuity errors.", "1.", "The story describes a poor woman who prays and gives to the poor.", "2.", "A grand temple is built, and a rich man gives many lanterns to the temple.", "3.", "The poor woman feels she has nothing to give to the temple but decides to sell her hair to buy a small temple light.", "4.", "During a festival, all the lanterns are lit, including the poor woman's small light.", "5.", "A sudden fierce wind extinguishes all the rich man's lanterns, but the poor woman's small light remains glowing brightly.", "Now, let's focus on the lanterns' characteristics mentioned in the story: - The story mentions that the lantern makers worked \"for days with matchless skill and patience\" to create a lantern of bronze so fine that \"all men wondered, for the workmanship was delicate and beautiful.", "\" - It also states that \"the stand was large and the light so small as to seem but a mere glimmer of the light of the world.\"", "Given these descriptions, the lanterns are quite large and powerful compared to the small light of the poor woman's hair.", "However, the story does not mention any lanterns being small in size or weak in light, which could be a potential contradiction.", "Checking the story again, we notice that the description of the lanterns is consistent throughout the text.", "The poor woman's light is described as \"tiny\" but \"bright as the light of day,\" which aligns with the idea of it being a small but powerful light.", "After careful analysis, there doesn't appear to be any clear contradiction or continuity error in the story based on the information provided."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst.

Indeed, some thought he had the best room of all, for though it was in the wing, it was spacious and well warmed, and had a side door, so that he could go in and out freely by day or night.</p><p>It must be said that he had earned his living on the place, being industrious and useful, a very handy man about the house; and the children had a liking for him because he sang merry songs and told beautiful fairy-tales.</p><p>So he was all the more surprised and aggrieved when the Master of the house said to him one night, as they sat late by the fire:</p><p>“I suspect you.”</p><p>“But of what?” cried the Guest.</p><p>“Of caring more for the house that you came from than for the house that you live in.”</p><p>“But you know I was at home there once,” said the Guest, “would you have me forget that? Surely you will not deny me the freedom of my thoughts and memories and fond feelings. Would you make me less than a man?”</p><p>“No,” said the Master, “but I will ask you to choose between your old home and your new home now. The house in which you lived formerly is become our enemy--a nest of brigands and bloody men. They have killed a child of ours on the  highway. They threaten us to-night with an attack in force. Tell me plainly where you stand.”</p><p>The Guest looked down his nose toward the smouldering  embers of the fire. He knocked out the dottle of his  pipe on one of the andirons. Two fat tears rolled down  his cheeks; he was very sentimental.</p><p>“I am with you,” he said.</p><p>“Good,” said the Master, “now let us make the house fast!”  [Illustration with caption: 'I will ask you to choose between your old home and your new home now.']</p><p>So they closed and barred the shutters and locked and bolted the front door.</p><p>Then they lighted their bedroom candles and bade each other good night.</p><p>But as the Guest went along his dim corridor, the Master turned and followed him very softly on tiptoe, watching.</p><p>Outside the house, in the darkness, there was a sound of many shuffling feet and whispering voices.</p><p>When the Guest came to the side door he tried the latch, to see that it was working freely. He moved the bolt, not forward into its socket, but backward so that it should be no hindrance. In the window beside the doorway he set his candle.  So the house was ready for late-comers.</p><p>Then the Guest sighed a little. “They are my old friends,” he murmured, “my dear old friends!  I could not leave them out in the cold. I am not responsible for what they do. Only I must my old affection prove.” So he sighed again and turned softly to his bed.</p><p>But as he turned the Master stood before him and took him by the throat.</p><p>“Traitor!” he cried. “You would betray the innocent. Already your soul is stained with my sleeping children's blood.” And with his hands he choked the false Guest to death.</p><p>Then he shot the bolt of the side door, and barred the window, and called the servants, and made ready to defend the house.</p><p>Great was the fighting that night.

Here, in the first rose, a bird was born. His flight was like the flashing of light, his plumage was beauteous, and his song ravishing. But when Eve plucked the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, when she and Adam were driven from Paradise, there fell from the flaming sword of the cherub a spark into the nest of the bird, which blazed up forthwith. The bird perished in the flames; but from the red egg in the nest there fluttered aloft a new one--the one solitary Phoenix bird. The fable tells that he dwells in Arabia, and that every hundred years, he burns himself to death in his nest; but each time a new Phoenix, the only one in the world, rises up from the red egg.</p><p>The bird flutters round us, swift as light, beauteous in color, charming in song. When a mother sits by her infant's cradle, he stands on the pillow, and, with his wings, forms a glory around the infant's head. He flies through the chamber of content, and brings sunshine into it, and the violets on the humble table smell doubly sweet.</p><p>But the Phoenix is not the bird of Arabia alone. He wings his way in the glimmer of the Northern Lights over the plains of Lapland, and hops among the yellow flowers in the short Greenland summer. Beneath the copper mountains of Fablun, and England's coal mines, he flies, in the shape of a dusty moth, over the hymnbook that rests on the knees of the pious miner. On a lotus leaf he floats down the sacred waters of the Ganges, and the eye of the Hindoo maid gleams bright when she beholds him.</p><p>The Phoenix bird, dost thou not know him?

He had one big book bound in black calf and clasped with iron, and with iron corners, and chained to a table which was made fast to the floor; and when he read out of this book, he unlocked it with an iron key, and none but he read from it, for it contained all the secrets of the spiritual world. It told how many angels there were in heaven, and how they marched in their ranks, and sang in their quires, and what were their several functions, and what was the name of each great angel of might. And it told of the demons, how many of them there were, and what were their several powers, and their labours, and their names, and how they might be summoned, and how tasks might be imposed on them, and how they might be chained to be as slaves to man.</p><p>Now the master had a pupil who was but a foolish lad, and he acted as servant to the great master, but never was he suffered to look into the black book, hardly to enter the private room.</p><p>One day the master was out, and then the lad, as curious as could be, hurried to the chamber where his master kept his wondrous apparatus for changing copper into gold, and lead into silver, and where was his mirror in which he could see all that was passing in the world, and where was the shell which when held to the ear whispered all the words that were being spoken by anyone the master desired to know about. The lad tried in vain with the crucibles to turn copper and lead into gold and silver--he looked long and vainly into the mirror; smoke and clouds passed over it, but he saw nothing plain, and the shell to his ear produced only indistinct murmurings, like the breaking of distant seas on an unknown shore. “I can do nothing,” he said; “as I don't know the right words to utter, and they are locked up in yon book.”</p><p>He looked round, and, see! the book was unfastened; the master had forgotten to lock it before he went out. The boy rushed to it, and unclosed the volume. It was written with red and black ink, and much of it he could not understand; but he put his finger on a line and spelled it through.</p><p>At once the room was darkened, and the house trembled; a clap of thunder rolled through the passage and the old room, and there stood before him a horrible, horrible form, breathing fire, and with eyes like burning lamps. It was the demon Beelzebub, whom he had called up to serve him.</p><p>“Set me a task!” said he, with a voice like the roaring of an iron furnace.</p><p>The boy only trembled, and his hair stood up.</p><p>“Set me a task, or I shall strangle thee!”</p><p>But the lad could not speak. Then the evil spirit stepped towards him, and putting forth his hands touched his throat. The fingers burned his flesh. “Set me a task!”</p><p>“Water yon flower,” cried the boy in despair, pointing to a geranium which stood in a pot on the floor. Instantly the spirit left the room, but in another instant he returned with a barrel on his back, and poured its contents over the flower; and again and again he went and came, and poured more and more water, till the floor of the room was ankle-deep.</p><p>“Enough, enough!” gasped the lad; but the demon heeded him not; the lad didn't know the words by which to send him away, and still he fetched water.</p><p>It rose to the boy's knees and still more water was poured.

Their situation on Lake Champlain gave them the command of the main route into Canada so that the possession of them would be all-important in case of hostilities. They were feebly garrisoned and negligently guarded, and abundantly furnished with artillery and military stores so needed by the patriot army.</p><p>At this juncture Ethan Allen stepped forward, a patriot, and volunteered with his “Green Mountain Boys.” He was well fitted for the enterprise. During the border warfare over the New Hampshire Grants, he and his lieutenants had been outlawed by the Legislature of New York and rewards offered for their apprehension. He and his associates had armed themselves, set New York at defiance, and had sworn they would be the death of any one who should try to arrest them.</p><p>Thus Ethan Allen had become a kind of Robin Hood among the mountains. His experience as a frontier champion, his robustness of mind and body, and his fearless spirit made him a most desirable leader in the expedition against Fort Ticonderoga. Therefore he was appointed at the head of the attacking force.</p><p>Accompanied by Benjamin Arnold and two other officers, Allen and his party of soldiers who had been enlisted from several States, set out and arrived at Shoreham, opposite Fort Ticonderoga on the shore of Lake Champlain. They reached the place at night-time. There were only a few boats on hand, but the transfer of men began immediately. It was slow work. The night wore away; day was about to break, and but eighty-three men, with Allen and Arnold, had crossed. Should they wait for the rest to cross over, day would dawn, the garrison wake, and their enterprise might fail.</p><p>Allen drew up his men, addressed them in his own emphatic style, and announced his intention of making a dash at the fort without waiting for more force.</p><p>“It is a desperate attempt,” said he, “and I ask no man to go against his will. I will take the lead, and be the first to advance. You that are willing to follow, poise your firelocks!”</p><p>Not a firelock but was poised!</p><p>They mounted the hill briskly but in silence, guided by a boy from the neighborhood.</p><p>The day dawned as Allen arrived at a sally-port. A sentry pulled trigger on him, but his piece missed fire. He retreated through a covered way. Allen and his men followed. Another sentry thrust at an officer with his bayonet, but was struck down by Allen, and begged for quarter. It was granted on condition of his leading the way instantly to the quarters of the commandant, Captain Delaplace, who was yet in bed.</p><p>Being arrived there, Allen thundered at the door, and demanded a surrender of the fort. By this time his followers had formed into two lines on the parade-ground, and given three hearty cheers.</p><p>The commandant appeared at the door half-dressed, the frightened face of his pretty wife peering over his shoulder.

But the Queen could not be brought to believe that her lord was dead, so she took refuge in the Tower of London from Sir Mordred's violence, nor was she to be induced to leave her strong refuge for aught that Mordred could promise or threaten.</p><p>This was the news that came to Arthur as he lay encamped about Sir Launcelot's castle of Benwick. Forthwith he bade his host make ready to move, and when they had reached the coast, they embarked and made sail to reach Britain with all possible speed.</p><p>Sir Mordred, on his part, had heard of their sailing, and despite his failed attempt to convince the lords of Arthur’s death, he hasted to get together a great army. It was grievous to see how many a stout knight held by Mordred, ay, even many whom Arthur himself had raised to honour and fortune; for it is the nature of men to be fickle. Thus it was that, when Arthur drew near to Dover, he found Mordred with a mighty host, waiting to oppose his landing. Then there was a great sea-fight, those of Mordred's party going out in boats, great and small, to board King Arthur's ships and slay him and his men or ever they should come to land. Right valiantly did King Arthur bear him, as was his wont, and boldly his followers fought in his cause, so that at last they drove off their enemies and landed at Dover in spite of Mordred and his array. For that time Mordred fled, and King Arthur bade those of his party bury the slain and tend the wounded.</p><p>So as they passed from ship to ship, salving and binding the hurts of the men, they came at last upon Sir Gawain, where he lay at the bottom of a boat, wounded to the death, for he had received a great blow on the wound that Sir Launcelot had given him. They bore him to his tent, and his uncle, the King, came to him, sorrowing beyond measure. \"Methinks,\" said the King, \"my joy on earth is done; for never have I loved any men as I have loved you, my nephew, and Sir Launcelot. Sir Launcelot I have lost, and now I see you on your death-bed.\" \"My King,\" said Sir Gawain, \"my hour is come, and I have got my death at Sir Launcelot's hand; for I am smitten on the wound he gave me. And rightly am I served, for of my willfulness and stubbornness comes this unhappy war. I pray you, my uncle, raise me in your arms and let me write to Sir Launcelot before I die.\"</p><p>Thus, then, Sir Gawain wrote: \"To Sir Launcelot, the noblest of all knights, I, Gawain, send greeting before I die. For I am smitten on the wound ye gave me before your castle of Benwick in France, and I bid all men bear witness that I sought my own death and that ye are innocent of it. I pray you, by our friendship of old, come again into Britain, and when ye look upon my tomb, pray for Gawain of Orkney.

In our nurseries we all learned that \"Taffy was a Welshman,\" but it was their enemies who made a bad rhyme about Taffy.</p><p>Wherever there were cows or goats, people could get milk. So they always had what was necessary for a good meal, whether it were breakfast, dinner or supper. Milk, cream, curds, whey and cheese enriched the family table. Were not these enough?</p><p>But Saint David taught the people how to make a still more delicious food out of cheese, and that this could be done without taking the life of any creature.</p><p>Saint David showed the girls how to take cheese, slice and toast it over the coals, or melt it in a skillet and pour it hot over toast or biscuit. This gave the cheese a new and sweeter flavor. When spread on bread, either plain, or browned over the fire, the result, in combination, was a delicacy fit for a king, and equal to anything known.</p><p>The fame of this new addition to the British bill of fare spread near and far. The English people, who had always been fond of rabbit pie, and still eat thousands of Molly Cotton Tails every day, named it \"Welsh Rabbit,\" and thought it one of the best things to eat. In fact, there are many people, who do not easily see a joke, who misunderstand the fun, or who suppose the name to be either slang, or vulgar, or a mistake, and who call it \"rarebit.\" It is like \"Cape Cod turkey\" (codfish), or \"Bombay ducks\" (dried fish), or \"Irish plums\" (potatoes) and such funny cookery with fancy names.</p><p>Now up to this time, the rabbits and hares had been so hunted with the aid of dogs, that there was hardly a chance of any of them surviving the cruel slaughter.</p><p>In the year 604, the Prince of Powys was out hunting. The dogs started a hare, and pursued it into a dense thicket. When the hunter with the horn came up, a strange sight met his eyes. There he saw a lovely maiden. She was kneeling on the ground and devoutly praying. Though surprised at this, the prince was anxious to secure his game. He hissed on the hounds and ordered the horn to be blown, for the dogs to charge on their prey, expecting them to bring him the game at once. Instead of this, though they were trained dogs and would fight even a wolf, they slunk away howling, and frightened, as if in pain, while the horn stuck fast to the lips of the blower and he was silent. Meanwhile, the hare nestled under the maiden's dress and seemed not in the least disturbed.</p><p>Amazed at this, the prince turned to the fair lady and asked:</p><p>\"Who are you?\"</p><p>She answered, \"My mother named me Monacella. I have fled from Ireland, where my father wished to marry me to one of his chief men, whom I did not love. Under God's guidance, I came to this secret desert place, where I have lived for fifteen years, without seeing the face of man.\"</p><p>To this, the prince in admiration replied: \"O most worthy Melangell [which is the way the Welsh pronounce Monacella], because, on account of thy merits, it has pleased God to shelter and save this little, wild hare, I, on my part, herewith present thee with this land, to be for the service of God and an asylum for all men and women, who seek thy protection. So long as they do not pollute this sanctuary, let none, not even prince or chieftain, drag them forth.\"</p><p>The beautiful saint passed the rest of her life in this place. At night, she slept on the bare engineered material. Many were the wonders wrought for those who with pure hearts sought her refuge.

Now and then he would gnaw at his mustache with his long, yellow teeth, or would sit down to let his lean horse rest, and would flip meaninglessly at the bushes with a switch.  Sometimes his bushy head would droop over on his breast, and he would snap it up sharply and start painfully on. Robber, cattle-thief, outlaw he might have been in another century; for he filled the figure of any robber hero in life or romance, and yet he was only the Senator from Bell, as he was known in the little Kentucky capital; or, as he was known in his mountain home, just the Senator, who had toiled and schemed and grown rich and grown poor; who had suffered long and was kind.</p><p>Only that Christmas he had gutted every store in town.  \"Give me everything you have, brother,\" he said, across each counter; and next day every man, woman, and child in the mountain town had a present from the Senator's hands.  He looked like a brigand that day, as he looked now, but he called every man his brother, and his eye, while black and lustreless as night, was as brooding and just as kind.</p><p>When the boom went down, with it and with everybody else went the Senator.  Slowly he got dusty, ragged, long of hair.  He looked tortured and ever-restless.  You never saw him still; always he swept by you, flapping his legs on his lean horse or his arms in his rickety buggy here, there, everywhere--turning, twisting, fighting his way back to freedom--and not a murmur.  Still was every man his brother, and if some forgot his once open hand, he forgot it no more completely than did the Senator.  He went very far to pay his debts.  He felt honor bound, indeed, to ask his sister to give back the farm that he had given her, which, very properly people said, she declined to do. Nothing could kill hope in the Senator's breast; he would hand back the farm in another year, he said; but the sister was firm, and without a word still, the Senator went other ways and schemed through the nights, and worked and rode and walked and traded through the days, until now, when the light was beginning to glimmer, his end was come.</p><p>This was the Senator's last trade, and in sight, down in a Kentucky valley, was home.  Strangely enough, the Senator did not care at all, and he had just enough sanity left to wonder why, and to be worried. It was the \"walking typhoid\" that had caught up with him, and he was listless, and he made strange gestures and did foolish things as he stumbled down the mountain. He was going over a little knoll now, and he could see the creek that ran around his house, but he was not touched.  He would just as soon have lain down right where he was, or have turned around and gone back, except that it was hot and he wanted to get to the water.  He remembered that it was nigh Christmas; he saw the snow about him and the cakes of ice in the creek.  He knew that he ought not to be hot, and yet he was--so hot that he refused to reason with himself even a minute, and hurried on.  It was odd that it should be so, but just about that time, over in Virginia, a cattle dealer, nearing home, stopped to tell a neighbor how he had tricked some black-whiskered fool up in the mountains.  It may have been just when he was laughing aloud over there, that the Senator, over here, tore his woollen shirt from his great hairy chest and rushed into the icy stream, clapping his arms to his burning sides and shouting in his frenzy.</p><p>\"If he had lived a little longer,\" said a constituent, \"he would have lost the next election.  He hadn't the money, you know.\"</p><p>\"If he had lived a little longer,\" said the mountain preacher high up on Yellow Creek, \"I'd have got that trade I had on hand with him through.  Not that I wanted him to die, but if he had to--why--\"</p><p>\"If he had lived a little longer,\" said the Senator's lawyer, \"he would have cleaned off the score against him.\"</p><p>\"If he had lived a little longer,\" said the Senator's sister, not meaning to be unkind, \"he would have got all I have.\"</p><p>That was what life held for the Senator.

Their situation on Lake Champlain gave them the command of the main route into Canada so that the possession of them would be all-important in case of hostilities. They were feebly garrisoned and negligently guarded, and abundantly furnished with artillery and military stores so needed by the patriot army.</p><p>At this juncture Ethan Allen stepped forward, a patriot, and volunteered with his “Green Mountain Boys.” He was well fitted for the enterprise. During the border warfare over the New Hampshire Grants, he and his lieutenants had been outlawed by the Legislature of New York and rewards offered for their apprehension. He and his associates had armed themselves, set New York at defiance, and had sworn they would be the death of any one who should try to arrest them.</p><p>Thus Ethan Allen had become a kind of Robin Hood among the mountains. His experience as a frontier champion, his robustness of mind and body, and his fearless spirit made him a most desirable leader in the expedition against Fort Ticonderoga. Therefore he was appointed at the head of the attacking force.</p><p>Accompanied by Benjamin Arnold and two other officers, Allen and his party of soldiers who had been enlisted from several States, set out and arrived at Shoreham, opposite Fort Ticonderoga on the shore of Lake Champlain. They reached the place at night-time. There were only a few boats on hand, but the transfer of men began immediately. It was slow work. The night wore away; day was about to break, and but eighty-three men, with Allen and Arnold, had crossed. Should they wait for the rest to cross over, day would dawn, the garrison wake, and their enterprise might fail.</p><p>Allen drew up his men, addressed them in his own emphatic style, and announced his intention of making a dash at the fort without waiting for more force.</p><p>“It is a desperate attempt,” said he, “and I ask no man to go against his will. I will take the lead, and be the first to advance. You that are willing to follow, poise your firelocks!”</p><p>Not a firelock but was poised!</p><p>They mounted the hill briskly but in silence, guided by a boy from the neighborhood.</p><p>The day dawned as Allen arrived at a sally-port. A sentry pulled trigger on him, but his piece missed fire. He retreated through a covered way. Allen and his men followed. Another sentry thrust at an officer with his bayonet, but was struck down by Allen, and begged for quarter. It was granted on condition of his leading the way instantly to the quarters of the commandant, Captain Delaplace, who was yet in bed.</p><p>Being arrived there, Allen thundered at the door, and demanded a surrender of the fort. By this time his followers had formed into two lines on the parade-ground, and given three hearty cheers.</p><p>The commandant appeared at the door half-dressed, the frightened face of his pretty wife peering over his shoulder. He gazed at Allen in bewildered astonishment.</p><p>“By whose authority do you act?” exclaimed he.</p><p>“In the name of the Continental Congress!” replied Allen, with a flourish of his sword, and an oath which we do not care to subjoin.</p><p>There was no disputing the point. The garrison, like the commandant, had been startled from sleep, and made prisoners as they rushed forth in their confusion. A surrender accordingly took place. The captain and forty-eight men who composed his garrison were sent prisoners to Hartford, in Connecticut.</p><p>And thus, while the capture did not significantly alter the broader strategic landscape, one of the important forts, useful for local control, fell into the hands of the patriots. -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to identify any potential continuity errors.", "1.", "**Initial Setup**: The story sets up the context of the forts being important for the patriot army and mentions Ethan Allen's background as a frontier champion.", "2. **Ethan Allen's Background**: It states that Ethan Allen and his lieutenants were outlawed by the New York Legislature and that rewards were offered for their apprehension.", "They had armed themselves and defied New York.", "3. **The Expedition**: The story describes how Ethan Allen and his men prepared to attack Fort Ticonderoga.", "It mentions that they were well-equipped and ready for the mission.", "4. **The Attack**: The narrative describes the attack in detail, including the confrontation with the sentries and the eventual surrender of the fort.", "Now, let's look for any contradictions: - **Rewards for Apprehension**: The story mentions that Ethan Allen and his men were \"outlawed by the New York Legislature and rewards offered for their apprehension.\"", "This suggests that they were wanted criminals. - **Attitude of the Patriots**: Later in the story, Ethan Allen is described as a leader of the attacking force, addressing his men and taking the lead.", "This implies that he is now a respected and trusted leader of the patriot army.", "**Potential Continuity Error**: - **Contradicted Lines**: - \"Ethan Allen and his lieutenants had been outlawed by the Legislature of New York and rewards offered for their apprehension.", "He and his associates had armed themselves, set New York at defiance, and had sworn they would be the death of any one who should try to arrest them.", "\" - \"Allen drew up his men, addressed them in his own emphatic style, and announced his intention of making a dash at the fort without waiting for more force.", "\" These lines suggest that Ethan Allen and his men were wanted criminals, which contradicts the later description of him as a respected leader of the patriot army.", "Therefore, there is a continuity error in the story.", "\\contradicted_lines Ethan Allen and his lieutenants had been outlawed by the Legislature of New York and rewards offered for their apprehension.", "He and his associates had armed themselves, set New York at defiance, and had sworn they would be the death of any one who should try to arrest them.", "Allen drew up his men, addressed them in his own emphatic style, and announced his intention of making a dash at the fort without waiting for more force.", "</contradicted_lines>"], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

Was that diplomatic blunder of two years ago so utterly unforgivable? Was exile not enough? Would the Republic deny him even the right to fight under her colours? \"The French Government declines to accept your services.\" The recruiting officer had said it, and General Joffre had reiterated the unrelenting statement in reply to his direct appeal for enlistment. And now the drone of the propeller, the hum of the motor, and the rush of the air through the braces whispered the words ceaselessly into his ears as the great wings carried him up into the darkness.</p><p>Below, the ghostly searchlight fingers of the fortress reached up, groping toward him. The central searchlight of the fortress was playing on a French cruiser which had crept up recklessly close to the fort and was pouring shells in rapid salvos up into the battlements on the hill. The sparks of fire from the ship's side seemed but tiny points of light far down below. Momentarily balls of flame appeared above and around the dim outlines of the fortifications, and the smoke of bursting shells drifted wanly across the white, searching pencils of light. Down there France, undaunted, grappled the Turk in the darkness. From the farther shore distant lights of Asia twinkled in the night.</p><p>Behind that central searchlight, Henri had said, lay the entrance to the powder magazine. That passageway was the vital spot of the fortress. An explosion there would ignite the ammunition and shatter the entire centre of the fortifications.</p><p>A searchlight came wheeling across the sky and shot past just behind the monoplane. The flash of the guns on the hill were now just beneath him, and their roar formed a surging background of sound to the whirr of the machine. He swept in a huge curve toward a position back of the fortress. The searchlight was circling the sky again. For a fraction of a second the aeroplane was silhouetted in its full glare. The beam wavered and returned zigzagging to pick him up again. This time it caught and followed him. A shell burst below him. If one fragment of shrapnel should strike the nitroglycerine which he carried France would profit little from this last ride of his.</p><p>The fortress was not far behind him. He swept about and pointed the nose of the monoplane downward straight toward the base of the central searchlight. Its beam had ceased to play on the battleship and was lifting swiftly toward him. Suddenly its glare caught him straight in the eyes. He gripped the controls and steered tensely for that dazzling target.</p><p>\"The French Government declines to accept your services.\" He smiled grimly. They could not well decline them now.

But, unfortunately, they left out one rather cross old fairy, and she was so angry that she said the princess should die when she reached the age of sixteen, by pricking her hand with a spindle.</p><p>All the other fairies present, except one, had already given the princess their beautiful gifts, and this last one said she could not prevent part of the wicked wish coming true; but her gift should be that the princess should not really die, but only fall into a deep sleep, which should last for a hundred years, and at the end of that time she should be awakened by a king's son.</p><p>It all happened as the fairies had predicted.

These humakins, as they were called, were made so carefully and with such art that no one could tell the difference between a real human and an artificial one--except that the artificial ones were flawless.  Physically the humakins were always young, always beautiful, always fresh; they never had a hair out of place, never a pimple, never a wrinkle, never a gray hair.  Mentally they were always bright, alert, and smiling; they always got their facts right, and never took a wrong turn or got lost.</p><p>At first the appeal of the humakins was irresistible, and most humans chose them over other humans for spouses.  What human female could compete with an always slim, beautiful, and lively imitation? And what human male could compete with an always confident, correct, and handsome construction?  In fact, the word \"humakin\" quickly became a synonym for \"perfect,\" as in, \"That's a really humakin car,\" or \"This pie tastes just humakin.\"  At the same time the word \"human\" became a term of opprobrium, indicating something defective or of low quality, as in, \"I never shop there because it's such a human store with human-quality merchandise.\"</p><p>To the consternation of many, however, while the humakins could construct more of themselves in a factory, the humans could produce more of themselves only by following the ancient method of their ancestors, so that the result of the marriages between flesh and plastic was the eventual decline of the human race.</p><p>When about nine tenths of the persons on the planet consisted of the precisely fabricated humakins and only one tenth of the really human, quite an odd and unexpected situation arose.  It had become so unusual to see, for example, a woman wearing glasses or a man with wind-blown hair that such a detail now took on a natural appeal to some of the other humans.</p><p>One bright morning at breakfast in a fancy resort dining room, a human female, almost as lovely as a humakin, sat chatting with a humakin male who had condescended to sit with her.  Suddenly she inadvertently spilled a glass of tomato juice onto her white tennis dress.  While her humakin companion predictably stood up and stared at her with horror, across the room a human male who had just witnessed the event was so filled with ardor and longing that he almost broke the table in his rush to get over to her and make her acquaintance.  His excitement to declare his affection left him without the capacity for coherent speech, so that only tentative and confused phrases stumbled from his mouth.  In the midst of his babbling, though, he could see, in the welling dew of the woman's eyes, the tenderness of regard he had inspired.</p><p>As other humans, too, began to grow weary of the expectation of constant perfection in their relationships, scenes similar to this one began to be repeated with increasing frequency.  A loose shoe lace, a chipped fingernail, a shiny nose--all gradually became sources of romantic and emotional attraction, and those very characteristics that had before been viewed as defects soon came to be seen as emblems of the truly and desirably human, as guarantees of that unique inner fire that no amount of perfectly crafted plastic could equal.</p><p>The word \"human\" now began to be associated with the genuine, the natural--and the beautiful.  It became not uncommon to hear a young lady remark to her admirer as he gently put a flower in her hair, \"Oh, what a human thing of you to do.\"  The word \"humakin,\" on the other hand, began to imply something slickly unrealistic or laughably fake and was often pronounced with a sneer.</p><p>At length, having rediscovered the amorous appeal of their distinctives like freckles and missing buttons and the inability to refold road maps, the humans began to marry each other again.  It wasn't many years before a young pledge of one of these new relationships was heard to ask in a tone of frustration, \"But Mommy, why must I have a crooked tooth?\"  To which the mother replied, \"That's so I'll always remember how truly beautiful you really are.\"</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's go through the story step by step to identify any potential continuity errors.", "1. **Introduction of Humakins:** - The humakins are described as physically perfect and mentally perfect. - Lines: \"Physically the humakins were always young, always beautiful, always fresh; they never had a hair out of place, never a pimple, never a wrinkle, never a gray hair.", "Mentally they were always bright, alert, and smiling; they always got their facts right, and never took a wrong turn or got lost.", "\" 2. **Human-Humakin Marriages:** - Initially, humans prefer humakins due to their perfection. - Lines: \"What human female could compete with an always slim, beautiful, and lively imitation?", "And what human male could compete with an always confident, correct, and handsome construction?\" 3. **Decline of Humans:** - Humans can only reproduce naturally, leading to a decline in the human population. - Line: \"The result of the marriages between flesh and plastic was the eventual decline of the human race.", "\" 4. **Change in Perception:** - Humans start to appreciate imperfections and view them as attractive. - Lines: \"A loose shoe lace, a chipped fingernail, a shiny nose--all gradually became sources of romantic and emotional attraction, and those very characteristics that had before been viewed as defects soon came to be seen as emblems of the truly and desirably human, as guarantees of that unique inner fire that no amount of perfectly crafted plastic could equal.\"", "5. **Final Scene:** - A young human child expresses frustration about having a crooked tooth. - Line: \"But Mommy, why must I have a crooked tooth?", "\" - Mother’s response: \"That's so I'll always remember how truly beautiful you really are.", "\" Upon reviewing the story, there doesn't appear to be any direct contradiction between the descriptions of humakins and the subsequent appreciation of human imperfections.", "The story logically transitions from the initial perfection of humakins to a preference for human flaws as a symbol of genuineness and beauty.", "Thus, there are no continuity errors in the provided story."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

Then when he found that he was being deserted, Sir Mordred withdrew to the far West, for there men knew less of what had happened, and so he might still find some to believe in him and support him; and being without conscience, he even called to his aid the heathen hosts that his uncle, King Arthur, had driven from the land, in the good years when Launcelot was of the Round Table.</p><p>King Arthur followed ever after; for in his heart was bitter anger against the false nephew who had wrought woe upon him and all his realm. At the last, when Mordred could flee no further, the two hosts were drawn up near the shore of the great western sea; and it was the Feast of the Holy Trinity.</p><p>That night, as King Arthur slept, he thought that Sir Gawain stood before him, looking just as he did in life, and said to him: \"My uncle and my King, God in his great love has suffered me to come unto you, to warn you that in no wise ye fight on the morrow; for if ye do, ye shall be slain, and with you the most part of the people on both sides. Make ye, therefore, treaty for a month, and within that time, Sir Launcelot shall come to you with all his knights, and ye shall overthrow the traitor and all that hold with him.\" Therewith, Sir Gawain vanished. Immediately, the King awoke and called to him the best and wisest of his knights, the two brethren, Sir Lucan the Butler and Sir Bedivere, and others, to whom he told his dream. Then all were agreed that, on any terms whatsoever, a treaty should be made with Sir Mordred, even as Sir Gawain had said; and, with the dawn, messengers went to the camp of the enemy, to call Sir Mordred to a conference. So it was determined that the meeting should take place in the sight of both armies, in an open space between the two camps, and that King Arthur and Mordred should each be accompanied by fourteen knights. Little enough faith had either in the other, so when they set forth to the meeting, they bade their hosts join battle if ever they saw a sword drawn. Thus they went to the conference.</p><p>Now as they talked, it befell that an adder, coming out of a bush hard by, stung a knight in the foot; and he, seeing the snake, drew his sword to kill it and thought no harm thereby. But on the instant that the sword flashed, the trumpets blared on both sides and the two hosts rushed to battle. With reinforced numbers, the clash was even more fierce and chaotic; for brother fought with brother, and comrade with comrade, and fiercely they cut and thrust, with many a bitter word between; while King Arthur himself, his heart hot within him, rode through and through the battle, seeking the traitor Mordred. So they fought all day, till at last the evening fell. Then Arthur, looking around him, saw of his valiant knights but two left, Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere, and these sore wounded; and there, over against him, by a great heap of the dead, stood Sir Mordred, the cause of all this ruin. Thereupon the King, his heart nigh broken with grief for the loss of his true knights, cried with a loud voice: \"Traitor! now is thy doom upon thee!\" and with his spear gripped in both hands, he rushed upon Sir Mordred and smote him that the weapon stood out a fathom behind. And Sir Mordred knew that he had his death-wound. With all the might that he had, he thrust him up the spear to the haft and, with his sword, struck King Arthur upon the head, that the steel pierced the helmet and bit into the head; then he fell back, stark and dead.</p><p>Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere went to the King where he lay, swooning from the blow, and bore him to a little chapel on the sea-shore.

These were magic blades, but they were not so keen and terrible as the sword of the Clustering Clouds of Heaven.</p><p>And this is the story of that sword:</p><p>Amaterasu, the sun goddess, had a superb sword, whose flashing blade was like a gleam of light. This sword she greatly prized, but a malicious dragon stole it away and carried it to his den. The goddess cried for aid to Susanoo, her brother, and he pursued the dragon. It was a horrible beast with eight heads and terrible claws, and it roared at the god with each of its eight mouths.</p><p>Susanoo was a crafty and clever warrior and he knew that he could conquer the dragon only by guile. So he gave him soft words and smiles.</p><p>“What a wonderful warrior you would make, Sir Dragon,” he said. “Had you but a sword you could conquer the world.”</p><p>“I am not without a weapon and that a magic one,” haughtily replied the great beast as he flapped his mighty tail. “Behold!” and as he spoke Susanoo saw that the magic sword was concealed beneath the dragon’s tail.</p><p>“I drink to your health, O Wonderful One!” he cried. “May you live as long as there is no one mightier.” And he offered him a huge draught of _saké_.[4]</p><p>“That is wishing that I may live forever,” said the dragon, and he drank off the _saké_ at a single gulp.</p><p>“You have said it,” said Susanoo with a deep reverence, and he offered him a second cup for his second head. By the time the dragon had taken eight cups, one for each of his great yawning mouths, his heads were so dizzy that he did not know at all what he was doing, and so he lay down to rest under the cliff.</p><p>Then Susanoo crept up and quickly struck off one of his heads and then another, and another until only one was left. By that time the dragon was quite wide-awake and very much enraged. He rushed at Susanoo and would have devoured him had not Amaterasu seen her brother’s danger. She sent a gleam of dazzling sunlight into the dragon’s eyes so that he could not see where he was going. Then Susanoo cut off the last head, and seizing the magic sword, bore it in triumph to his sister. She placed it in a shrine for safe-keeping and there it remained for many a day.</p><p>It was not to rest there always, however, for another hero was to wield it, and this was Yamato-Daké, son of the Emperor Koan.</p><p>A terrible war was being waged with the savages in the eastern part of Japan, and Yamato went forth to conquer them, bearing with him the Sacred Sword. But the savages were not easy to overcome.

The minstrel said: I will go to the wedding, and you shall go the funeral. The Lord went to the funeral, and succeeded in raising the dead man. He received a reward of one hundred ducats.</p><p>The minstrel went to the wedding, and ate his fill. And he returned home, and found his companion, who had earned his reward. He praised him. The Lord had eaten nothing. The minstrel obtained some money from him, and bought a fat kid, and roasted it. And as he roasted it, he drew out the kidneys, and ate them.</p><p>When it was set before his companion, the latter asked for the kidneys. The minstrel replied: the kids in this region have no kidneys.</p><p>Now it befell, on another occasion, that another wedding was announced, and another rich man died. And God said: this time I wish to go the wedding, and do you go to the funeral; and I will show you how to raise the dead man. You shall make the sign of the cross on him, and you shall bid him to rise, and he will arise. But first of all, let them promise you a reward. The minstrel said: indeed, so I will.</p><p>He went, and promised to raise him; but he did not rise, for all his signing.</p><p>The dead man was the son of a great lord.</p><p>The father waxed wroth, seeing that this man was making a mock of him. He sent him away to be hanged by the neck.</p><p>The Lord went out to meet him, and said: Do not fear, for I will raise him; but tell me, on your honour, who did eat the kidneys of the kid? The minstrel replied: By that holy world whither I must go, oh my partner, I did not eat them. The Lord, seeing that he could not make him confess, had pity on him. So he went, and raised the dead man. And the other was set free, and received the recompense that he had been promised. They returned home. The Lord said: O my partner, I wish to leave you, because I have not found you to be as loyal as I thought you were.</p><p>And he, seeing that it must be so perforce, said: I am content. Do you divide, and I will take my share. The Lord divided the money into three parts. And the minstrel said: What are you doing? We are but two. Said the Lord: That is indeed so; but this one part shall belong to him who ate the kidneys, and the others shall be, one yours and one mine.</p><p>Then the minstrel said: By my faith, since you speak this, I must indeed tell you that I did eat them. I am so old, that I may tell no more lies. And so such things can be proved for money, which a man will confess who would not confess them in order to save his own life [134].</p><p> LXXVI</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to detect any continuity errors.", "1.", "**First Encounter at the Wedding and Funeral:** - The Lord goes to the funeral and raises the dead man, receiving 100 ducats. -", "The minstrel goes to the wedding, eats his fill, returns, and receives some money from the Lord.", "2.", "**Second Encounter at the Wedding and Funeral:** - The Lord asks the minstrel to go to the funeral and promises to raise the dead man.", "- The minstrel fails to raise the dead man despite making the sign of the cross. -", "The father of the dead man is angry and has the minstrel hanged.", "3. **Aftermath:** - The Lord meets the minstrel and asks who ate the kidneys.", "- The minstrel initially denies eating the kidneys but later admits to it under pressure.", "**Analysis:** - There seems to be no direct contradiction between the events described in the story.", "Each event builds upon the previous ones without conflicting information.", "The minstrel’s actions and the outcomes are consistent with the narrative.", "- The only potential issue might be in the last part where the minstrel admits to eating the kidneys, but this does not contradict any earlier statements or actions.", "Given that each event flows logically from the previous one and there is no information that contradicts itself, we conclude that there is no continuity error in the provided story."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

A few yards back, where the spring crossed the trail, there were tracks of a woman's shoe-pack. It was country where one didn't live long without the habit of noticing things. The tracks were light, mostly toes, and far apart for so small a foot. Johnson knew no woman travelled north so fast, into the wilderness, and without a pack, at that, for diversion, so he had sidestepped from the trail, silently slipped off his tump-line, and circled to the edge of the clearing, about a dozen yards from where the trail struck it. There in the shadow of the pines he searched the clearing with his eyes. No sign of life.</p><p>The door of the hut was shut, but a couple of boards had been knocked off one of the window openings. The tall grass was trampled toward the spring. Over to the right was a wreck of a birch, where some one had been cutting firewood. Nothing especially alarming, but Johnson was not popular and a few early experiences had made him cautious. He stood there, silent, for perhaps fifteen minutes, before he started for the door. There was still no sound, and he stepped inside, gun in hand.</p><p>A rusty little yacht stove, a few shelves, and a rude table were all the cookroom contained. Beyond was the bunkroom with a large double-decked bunk against one wall, and opposite it the window. Johnson went on in.</p><p>In the lower bunk lay the body of a man with a hunting knife sticking in his breast. He lay staring at the ceiling with a rather silly smile, as though he had been grinning, and death had come too quickly for it to fade.</p><p>\"MacNamara---- My God!\"</p><p>Johnson was unnerved. It was not often that men die by the knife in the North country. Then a great load seemed to leave his shoulders, for this dead man had sworn, not three weeks before, to shoot him at sight--and Johnson was known to be a coward. No more need he sleep with an eye open, or slip into towns at night. MacNamara, thank God, was dead.</p><p>The dead man's pack was in the other bunk, and scattered around the room were hairpins, a small rhinestone ring, and a few other feminine trinkets. \"Woman!\" said Johnson--and then he saw the note. It was scrawled on the cover torn from an old magazine. It read:</p><p>  \"Ed, you'll find this sure. Mac was going to lay for you and pot you   at the White Rocks. I couldn't find you, so I promised to come here   to Carmels with him. When he climbed in the bunk I give it to   him--the damned fool!\"</p><p>It was unsigned.</p><p>The sun was very near the western hilltop. Johnson went to the woods and returned with his pack; he dropped it near the stove in the cookroom. Then he burned the note. Next he took a small bag of parched corn out of his pack and concealed in it the woman's little things, and put the bag in his shirt. There remained only one thing to do. Without looking at the dead man's face he drew the knife out of his breast and forced his own into the wound. The woman's knife he took to the door and hurled far out into the woods.</p><p>There wasn't much daylight left.

A very small bit of this chestnut grated into a kettle would make a potful of porridge.</p><p></p><p>In a certain wigwam lived Deerheart and Sky Elk, and their little son Greedy Fawn. The mother was called Deerheart because she was so loving, and gentle, and kind. The father was named Sky Elk because he was so strong and fleet of foot. Greedy Fawn, too, came rightly by his name. You will soon know why.</p><p>One day, Deerheart and Sky Elk went on a long trail. As they left the wigwam, they said to Greedy Fawn, \"Do not touch the chestnut, do not build a fire, while we are away.\"</p><p>Greedy Fawn promised. He watched his father and mother disappear down the western trail. Then he went back to the wigwam.</p><p>\"Now,\" thought he, \"I will have all the porridge I want.\"</p><p>So he ran and gathered some sticks. He built a fire with the sticks. Then he hung the kettle over the fire, and put some water in it. Then he found the chestnut. He grated a little of the chestnut into the kettle, and began to stir.

Harder and harder he stirred to keep the porridge from boiling over. Beads of perspiration ran down his little bronze face, yet still he stirred. He dared not stop.</p><p>Then he remembered that sometimes his mother would rap the kettle with the porridge stick, if it became too full.</p><p>Rap, rap, rap, went the porridge stick on the edge of the kettle. Instantly the _kettle_ began to swell. Larger, and larger, and larger it grew. Greedy Fawn was so frightened he did not know what to do.</p><p>Now Greedy Fawn could not reach across the kettle, to stir the porridge with his stick, so he began to run around it. And around, and around, and around the kettle he ran, stirring, and stirring, and stirring.</p><p>At last the kettle was so large that it nearly filled the wigwam. There was just space enough left for Greedy Fawn to run around it. And around, and around, and around the kettle he ran, stirring, and stirring, and stirring.</p><p>Oh, how his little arms ached! And, oh, how tired his small legs were! But still he ran. He dared not stop.</p><p>Here was porridge enough to last a small boy a lifetime, and he could not stop to taste one mouthful!</p><p></p><p>At last Greedy Fawn could run no longer. He stumbled and fell by the side of the kettle. He was too weak to rise. The stick fell from his hand, and the porridge boiled on. Higher, and higher, and higher it rose, until it ran over and down the sides of the kettle. Closer, and closer the boiling porridge crept to the little Indian boy, and soon Greedy Fawn and his stick were nearly buried in porridge.</p><p>For once Greedy Fawn had all the porridge he wanted. And never again would he have wanted anything, had not Deerheart and Sky Elk heard his cries, and come running like deer up the trail to save him.

It was then that a huntsman, bearing the name of Alpheus, ranged through the woods, and chased the wild deer among the glades and glens of sweet Arcadia. Far away by the lonely sea dwelt his fair young wife, and his lovely babe Orsilochus; but dearer than home or wife or babe to Alpheus, was the free life of the huntsman among the mountain solitudes. For he loved the woods and the blue sky and the singing birds, and the frail flowers upon the hillside; and he longed to live among them always, where his ears could listen to their music, and his eyes look upon their beauty.</p><p>\"O Artemis, huntress queen!\" he cried, \"I ask but one boon of thee. Let me ramble forever among these happy scenes!\"</p><p>Artemis heard him, and answered his prayer. For, as he spoke, a bright vision passed before him. A sweet-faced maiden went tripping down the valley, culling the choicest flowers, and singing of hope and joy and the blessedness of a life pure and true. It was Arethusa, the Arcadian nymph, by some supposed to be a daughter of old Nereus, the elder of the sea.</p><p>Then Alpheus heard no more the songs of the birds, or the music of the breeze; he saw no longer the blue sky above him, or the nodding flowers at his feet: he was blind and deaf to all the world, save only the beautiful nymph. Arethusa was the world to him.</p><p>He reached out his arms to catch her; but, swifter than a frightened deer, she fled down the valley, through deep ravines and grassy glades and rocky caverns underneath the hills, and out into the grassy meadows, and across the plains of Elis, to the sounding sea. And Alpheus followed, forgetful of everything but the fleeing vision. When, at length, he reached the sea, he looked back; and, lo! he was no longer a huntsman, but a river doomed to meander forever among the scenes, for love of which he had forgotten his wife, and the duties of life.

They were perfectly naked, and, as they stood gazing at the ships, appeared by their attitudes and gestures to be lost in astonishment.</p><p>Columbus made signals for the ships to cast anchor and the boats to be manned and armed. He entered his own boat, richly attired in scarlet, and holding the royal standard; while Martin Alonzo Pinzon and his brother put off in company in their boats, each with a banner of the enterprise emblazoned with a green cross, having on either side the letters “F.” and “Y.,” the initials of the Castilian monarchs Fernando and Ysabel, surmounted by crowns.</p><p>As he approached the shore, Columbus was delighted with the purity and suavity of the atmosphere, the crystal transparency of the sea, and the extraordinary beauty of the vegetation. He beheld also fruits of an unknown kind upon the trees which overhung the shores.</p><p>On landing he threw himself on his knees, kissed the earth, and returned thanks to God with tears of joy. His example was followed by the rest. [9] “Almighty and Eternal God,” prayed Columbus, “who by the energy of Thy creative word hast made the firmament, the earth and the sea; blessed and glorified be thy name in all places! May thy majesty and dominion be exalted for ever and ever, as Thou hast permitted thy holy name to be made known and spread by the most humble of thy servants, in this hitherto unknown portion of Thine empire.”</p><p>[Footnote: 9: This prayer is taken from Lamartine.]</p><p>Columbus, then rising, drew his sword, displayed the royal standard, and assembling around him the two captains and the rest who had landed, he took solemn possession in the name of the Castilian sovereigns, giving the island the name of San Salvador.

It is only within the last year, however, that it has been discovered that an over-indulgence in dialect stories is liable to bring on an affection of the tongue.</p><p>A peculiarly sad case and the most notable that has thus far been brought to the attention of the public is that of Deacon Azariah Perkins of West Hartford, Connecticut.</p><p>Far from deploring the spread of the dialect story, he reveled in it, reading all the tales that he could get hold of in magazines or circulating library. But his was not a healthy, catholic taste; he had ears and eyes for one dialect alone--the negro. For him Ian Maclaren and Barrie spread their most tempting Scotch jaw-breakers in vain; he had no desire for them. After fifteen years of negro dialect in every form in which Southern and Northern writers can serve it, any specialist in nervous disorders could have told the deacon that he was liable to have “negromania”; but West Hartford does not employ specialists, and so the stroke came unheralded, with all the suddenness of apoplexy.</p><p>Deacon Perkins has always been able to think standing; indeed, he has been called the Chauncey Depew of West Hartford, and no revival meeting or strawberry festival or canned clam-bake was considered a success unless the deacon’s ready tongue took part in the exercises.</p><p></p><p>Last Sunday they had a children’s festival in the Congregational Church, and after the children had made an end of reciting and singing, the deacon was called upon for a few remarks. He is a favorite with young and old, and a man of great purity and simplicity of character. He arose with alacrity and walked down the isle with the lumbering gait peculiar to New-Englanders who have struggled with rocky farms the best part of their lives.

Sweet music was discoursed by the chestnut bell, and, despite their age and many infirmities, the members wore a look of gaiety suitable to so festive an occasion. There was not a young joke among them, excepting a very few special jokes like the Trolley variety and the Cuban War joke, and these, from overwork, were as superannuated-looking as the oldest there. Not a well-known joke but would come. Of course they would all live until the next dinner, for an old joke is immortal; but this yearly gathering was their only chance to meet and shake hands generally, as during the rest of the year they would be scattered through the columns of the dailies and the comic weeklies, and their meetings would be chance ones.</p><p>The hearty old Mother-in-law joke chatted gaily with that venerable old lady, I-will-be-a-sister-to-you. The adorable twins, Ballet-girl’s-age and Ballet-girl’s-scant-raiment, were the center of a group made up of the haughty Rich-plumber, the Rejected-manuscript, the Slow-messenger-boy, the Sleeping-watchman, and a good score of Boarding-house jokes. The one called Boarding-house-coffee felt a little stirred up at the false report that he was losing ground, and he had an unsettled look upon his swarthy and senile features. The idea was absurd on the face of it, for undoubtedly he would be printed in every section of the country before the month was out, as he had been any month for decades past. The Summer jokes, including, of course, the star jest, the Summer-girl, looked comparatively fresh, as they were not in use the year round, like Her-father’s-foot, for instance, or that other member of the same family, the Chicago-girl’s-foot, that year in and year out is used as a laugh-producer.</p><p></p><p>The Boston jokes, icy and reserved, sat apart from the rest, and glared at each other in a near-sighted way. The Freak jokes, on the contrary, were hail-fellow-well-met with everyone, and their vulgar laughter could be heard everywhere. Many had caught up just last month at a smaller gathering, yet the excitement of the annual dinner brought a special joy.</p><p>A good deal of sympathy was expressed for Actor-walking-home, for he was so feeble that he had to be helped across the room by Weary Wraggles. The Tramps were out in force. Tickets to the dinner were five dollars, and it was rumored that Dusty Rhodes had worked his way in, but upon reflection the idea will be seen to be preposterous.</p><p>There was a strong smell of cloves in the air when the door opened for the entrance of old Between-the-acts. He came arm in arm with that other favorite, Detained-at-the-lodge.</p><p>The Farmer jokes came in a little late. Their chores had detained them. But their entrance was hailed with delight by a body of paragraphers who sat in the gallery as representatives of the press, and who had paid many a bill, thanks to the Farmers.</p><p>A joke, rather square-cut and with wheels in his head, came in with a “Where is she?” look on his dial, and as soon as he said, “I expected to meter here,” he was recognized as Big-gas-bill. The Wheel jokes were conspicuous by their absence. This was explained on the ground that they were not yet old enough to become Hoary Chestnuts, and, as a relentless paragrapher remarked, “They were tired, anyhow.”</p><p>The last ones to arrive were the Cannibal and Tough-missionary; and the chairman of the reception committee having assigned them seats at opposite ends of the table, all sat down, and the annual balloting to determine what had been the most popular joke of the year was begun.</p><p>Many voted for themselves, notably the Boston-bean joke and the Rich-plumber; but when the votes were counted, the successful person proved to be neither of these, but a hideously homely woman with a perpetual smirk upon her face.</p><p>“Who’s she?” asked one paragrapher of another.</p><p>“You don’t know her? Why, that’s My-face-is-my-fortune-then-you-must-be-dead-broke.”</p><p>And they crowned her with laurel as unquestionably the most perennially popular joke. -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to identify any potential continuity errors.", "1. **Identify key events and details:** - The Hoary Chestnuts are gathering for their annual Christmas dinner. - There are various types of jokes present, such as the Summer jokes, the Boston jokes, the Freak jokes, etc. - Some jokes are described as being \"superannuated\" (very old) or \"fresh\" (new).", "- The story mentions that some jokes are \"immortal\" and will be printed in every section of the country.", "- The story introduces a new joke, \"My-face-is-my-fortune-then-you-must-be-dead-broke,\" as the most popular joke of the year.", "2. **Check for contradictions:** - The story states that an old joke is immortal and will be printed in every section of the country for decades.", "However, the newly introduced joke, \"My-face-is-my-fortune-then-you-must-be-dead-broke,\" is described as the most popular joke of the year, which seems to contradict the notion that old jokes are immortal and will continue to be printed.", "3. **Identify the contradictory lines:** - Contradicted_lines: - \"The idea was absurd on the face of it, for undoubtedly they would all live until the next dinner, for an old joke is immortal; but this yearly gathering was their only chance to meet and shake hands generally, as during the rest of the year they would be scattered through the columns of the dailies and the comic weeklies, and their meetings would be chance ones.\" - \"Many voted for themselves, notably the Boston-bean joke and the Rich-plumber; but when the votes were counted, the successful person proved to be neither of these, but a hideously homely woman with a perpetual smirk upon her face.", "\" - \"‘Who’s she?’ asked one paragrapher of another.\" - \"‘You don’t know her?", "Why, that’s My-face-is-my-fortune-then-you-must-be-dead-broke.’", "\" - \"And they crowned her with laurel as unquestionably the most perennially popular joke.", "\" Based on the analysis, there is a continuity error in the story where the introduction of a new joke as the most popular one contradicts the description of old jokes being immortal and continuing to be printed."], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

Its trunk is split clear through the middle, and grass and blackberry tendrils creep out through the cleft. The tree bends forward, and its branches droop like long, green hair.</p><p>In the fields around the willow grew rye, wheat, and oats--beautiful oats that, when ripe, looked like little yellow canary birds sitting on a branch. The harvest had been blessed, and the fuller the ears of grain the lower they bowed their heads in reverent humility.</p><p>There was also a field of buckwheat lying just in front of the old willow. The buckwheat did not bow its head, like the rest of the grain, but stood erect in stiff-necked pride.</p><p>\"I am quite as rich as the oats,\" it said; \"and, moreover, I am much more sightly. My flowers are as pretty as apple blossoms. It is a treat to look at me and my companions. Old willow, do you know anything more beautiful than we?\"</p><p>The willow nodded his head, as much as to say, \"Indeed I do!\" But the buckwheat was so puffed with pride that it only said: \"The stupid tree! He is so old that grass is growing out of his body.\"</p><p>Now there came on a dreadful storm, and the flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent their heads as it passed over them. The buckwheat flower alone stood erect in all its pride.</p><p>\"Bow your heads, as we do,\" called the flowers.</p><p>\"There is no need for me to do that,\" answered the buckwheat.</p><p>\"Bow your head as we do,\" said the grain. \"The angel of storms comes flying hither. He has wings that reach from the clouds to the earth; he will smite you before you have time to beg for mercy.\"</p><p>\"But I do not choose to bow down,\" said the buckwheat.</p><p>\"Close your flowers and fold your leaves,\" said the wind, carrying the words of the old willow from afar. \"Do not look at the lightning when the cloud breaks. Even human beings dare not do that, for in the midst of the lightning one may look straight into God's heaven. The sight strikes human beings blind, so dazzling is it. What would not happen to us, mere plants of the field, who are so much humbler, if we should dare do so?\"</p><p>\"So much humbler! Indeed! If there is a chance, I shall look right into God's heaven.\" And in its pride and haughtiness it did so. The flashes of lightning were so awful that it seemed as if the whole world were in flames.</p><p>When the tempest was over, both the grain and the flowers, greatly refreshed by the rain, again stood erect in the pure, quiet air. But the buckwheat had been burned as black as a cinder by the lightning and stood in the field like a dead, useless weed.</p><p>The old willow waved his branches to and fro in the wind, and large drops of water fell from his green leaves, as if he were shedding tears. The sparrows asked: \"Why are you weeping when all around seems blest? Do you not smell the sweet perfume of flowers and bushes? The sun shines, and the clouds have passed from the sky. Why do you weep, old tree?\"</p><p>Then the willow told them of the buckwheat's stubborn pride and of the punishment which followed, even though it stood afar and could only witness the events from a distance.</p><p>I, who tell this tale, heard it from the sparrows.

Now, it's not so much because of her quickness, though people make so much fuss about that. If we could only _notice_ her in time, I've no doubt we're nimble enough to jump into our holes before she could do us any harm. It's in her velvet paws, there's where she hides her cruel claws till she gets us in her clutches--that's where her power lies. With those paws she can tread so lightly that we can't hear her coming. And so, while _we_ are still dancing heedlessly about the place, she creeps close up, and before we know where we are she pounces down on us and has us in her clutches. Well, then, it's my opinion we ought to hang a bell round her neck to warn us of her coming while there's yet time.\"</p><p>Every one applauded this proposal, though it was not what they had gathered to discuss.

Now, it's not so much because of her quickness, though people make so much fuss about that. If we could only _notice_ her in time, I've no doubt we're nimble enough to jump into our holes before she could do us any harm. It's in her velvet paws, there's where she hides her cruel claws till she gets us in her clutches--that's where her power lies. With those paws she can tread so lightly that we can't hear her coming. And so, while _we_ are still dancing heedlessly about the place, she creeps close up, and before we know where we are she pounces down on us and has us in her clutches.

Immediately in front of the house was a lawn, perhaps fifty yards in extent between the house and public road, or, as it was called, the “pike.”  Beyond this road lay a close-cropped pasture of some ten acres, level and without a tree, rock, or any natural or artificial object on its surface.  At the time there was not even a domestic animal in the field.  In another field, beyond the pasture, a dozen slaves were at work under an overseer.</p><p>Throwing away the stump of a cigar, the planter rose, saying: “I forgot to tell Andrew about those horses.”  Andrew was the overseer.</p><p>Williamson strolled leisurely down the gravel walk, plucking a flower as he went, passed across the road and into the pasture, pausing a moment as he closed the gate leading into it, to greet a passing neighbor, Armour Wren, who lived on an adjoining plantation.  Mr. Wren was in an open carriage with his son James, a lad of thirteen.  When he had driven some two hundred yards from the point of meeting, Mr. Wren said to his son: “I forgot to tell Mr. Williamson about those horses.”</p><p>Mr. Wren had sold to Mr. Williamson some horses, which were to have been sent for that day, but for some reason not now remembered it would be inconvenient to deliver them until the morrow.  The coachman was directed to drive back, and as the vehicle turned Williamson was seen by all three, walking leisurely across the pasture. He seemed to be heading towards one of the horses that had strayed a bit farther from the rest. At that moment one of the coach horses stumbled and came near falling.  It had no more than fairly recovered itself when James Wren cried: “Why, father, what has become of Mr. Williamson?”</p><p>It is not the purpose of this narrative to answer that question.</p><p>Mr. Wren’s strange account of the matter, given under oath in the course of legal proceedings relating to the Williamson estate, here follows:</p><p>“My son’s exclamation caused me to look toward the spot where I had seen the deceased [_sic_] an instant before, but he was not there, nor was he anywhere visible.  I cannot say that at the moment I was greatly startled, or realized the gravity of the occurrence, though I thought it singular.  My son, however, was greatly astonished and kept repeating his question in different forms until we arrived at the gate.  My black boy Sam was similarly affected, even in a greater degree, but I reckon more by my son’s manner than by anything he had himself observed.  [This sentence in the testimony was stricken out.]  As we got out of the carriage at the gate of the field, and while Sam was hanging [_sic_] the team to the fence, Mrs. Williamson, with her child in her arms and followed by several servants, came running down the walk in great excitement, crying: ‘He is gone, he is gone!  O God! what an awful thing!’ and many other such exclamations, which I do not distinctly recollect.  I got from them the impression that they related to something more—than the mere disappearance of her husband, even if that had occurred before her eyes.  Her manner was wild, but not more so, I think, than was natural under the circumstances.  I have no reason to think she had at that time lost her mind.  I have never since seen nor heard of Mr. Williamson.”</p><p>This testimony, as might have been expected, was corroborated in almost every particular by the only other eye-witness (if that is a proper term)—the lad James.  Mrs. Williamson had lost her reason and the servants were, of course, not competent to testify.  The boy James Wren had declared at first that he _saw_ the disappearance, but there is nothing of this in his testimony given in court.  None of the field hands working in the field to which Williamson was going had seen him at all, and the most rigorous search of the entire plantation and adjoining country failed to supply a clue. The animals, though present, showed no signs of disturbance and offered no clues as to Williamson’s whereabouts. The most monstrous and grotesque fictions, originating with the blacks, were current in that part of the State for many years, and probably are to this day; but what has been here related is all that is certainly known of the matter.

Immediately in front of the house was a lawn, perhaps fifty yards in extent between the house and public road, or, as it was called, the “pike.”  Beyond this road lay a close-cropped pasture of some ten acres, level and without a tree, rock, or any natural or artificial object on its surface.  At the time there was not even a domestic animal in the field.  In another field, beyond the pasture, a dozen slaves were at work under an overseer.</p><p>Throwing away the stump of a cigar, the planter rose, saying: “I forgot to tell Andrew about those horses.”  Andrew was the overseer.</p><p>Williamson strolled leisurely down the gravel walk, plucking a flower as he went, passed across the road and into the pasture, pausing a moment as he closed the gate leading into it, to greet a passing neighbor, Armour Wren, who lived on an adjoining plantation.  Mr. Wren was in an open carriage with his son James, a lad of thirteen.  When he had driven some two hundred yards from the point of meeting, Mr. Wren said to his son: “I forgot to tell Mr. Williamson about those horses.”</p><p>Mr. Wren had sold to Mr. Williamson some horses, which were to have been sent for that day, but for some reason not now remembered it would be inconvenient to deliver them until the morrow.  The coachman was directed to drive back, and as the vehicle turned Williamson was seen by all three, walking leisurely across the pasture. He seemed to be heading towards one of the horses that had strayed a bit farther from the rest. At that moment one of the coach horses stumbled and came near falling.  It had no more than fairly recovered itself when James Wren cried: “Why, father, what has become of Mr. Williamson?”</p><p>It is not the purpose of this narrative to answer that question.</p><p>Mr. Wren’s strange account of the matter, given under oath in the course of legal proceedings relating to the Williamson estate, here follows:</p><p>“My son’s exclamation caused me to look toward the spot where I had seen the deceased [_sic_] an instant before, but he was not there, nor was he anywhere visible.  I cannot say that at the moment I was greatly startled, or realized the gravity of the occurrence, though I thought it singular.  My son, however, was greatly astonished and kept repeating his question in different forms until we arrived at the gate.  My black boy Sam was similarly affected, even in a greater degree, but I reckon more by my son’s manner than by anything he had himself observed.  [This sentence in the testimony was stricken out.]  As we got out of the carriage at the gate of the field, and while Sam was hanging [_sic_] the team to the fence, Mrs. Williamson, with her child in her arms and followed by several servants, came running down the walk in great excitement, crying: ‘He is gone, he is gone!  O God! what an awful thing!’ and many other such exclamations, which I do not distinctly recollect.  I got from them the impression that they related to something more—than the mere disappearance of her husband, even if that had occurred before her eyes.  Her manner was wild, but not more so, I think, than was natural under the circumstances.  I have no reason to think she had at that time lost her mind.  I have never since seen nor heard of Mr. Williamson.”</p><p>This testimony, as might have been expected, was corroborated in almost every particular by the only other eye-witness (if that is a proper term)—the lad James.  Mrs. Williamson had lost her reason and the servants were, of course, not competent to testify.  The boy James Wren had declared at first that he _saw_ the disappearance, but there is nothing of this in his testimony given in court.  None of the field hands working in the field to which Williamson was going had seen him at all, and the most rigorous search of the entire plantation and adjoining country failed to supply a clue. The animals, though present, showed no signs of disturbance and offered no clues as to Williamson’s whereabouts. The most monstrous and grotesque fictions, originating with the blacks, were current in that part of the State for many years, and probably are to this day; but what has been here related is all that is certainly known of the matter.  The courts decided that Williamson was dead, and his estate was distributed according to law. -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to identify any continuity errors.", "1.", "**Initial Setup:** - The story sets up a scene where Williamson, an overseer named Andrew, and a passing neighbor Mr. Wren and his son James are involved.", "- There are no horses mentioned in the pasture initially, and Williamson is described as walking across the pasture.", "2. **First Mention of Horses:** - Williamson mentions to Andrew about \"those horses\" he forgot to tell him about.", "This implies that the horses were already present in the pasture, but they weren't mentioned earlier.", "3. **Mr. Wren's Mention:** - Mr. Wren also says he forgot to tell Mr. Williamson about those horses.", "This is consistent with Williamson's statement.", "4.", "**Incident with Coach Horse:** - A coach horse stumbles and nearly falls.", "At this moment, James Wren notices that Mr. Williamson is not where he last saw him.", "5.", "**Mr. Wren's Testimony:** - Mr. Wren states that he last saw Williamson in the pasture, but he was not there anymore.", "This introduces a contradiction because earlier, it was stated that Williamson was walking across the pasture and was heading towards one of the horses.", "6.", "**Witness Accounts:** - Mrs. Williamson and the servants describe seeing Williamson disappear, which aligns with Mr. Wren's testimony.", "Given the analysis, there is a clear contradiction in the story regarding the location of Mr. Williamson at the critical moment.", "**Contradicted Lines:** - \"At that moment one of the coach horses stumbled and came near falling.", "It had no more than fairly recovered itself when James Wren cried: 'Why, father, what has become of Mr. Williamson?'\" - \"[...] but he was not there, nor was he anywhere visible.\"", "The story suggests that Williamson was walking across the pasture and then disappeared, which contradicts the earlier description of him being in the process of walking towards one of the horses."], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

Into that thou shalt enter.\" Immediately, Sir Launcelot started from his sleep to obey and, riding along the shore, came presently to a ship beached on the strand; no sooner had he entered it, than the ship was launched--how, he might not know. So the ship sailed before the wind for many a day. No mortal was on it, save only Sir Launcelot, yet were all his needs supplied. Then, at last, the ship ran ashore at the foot of a great castle; and it was midnight. Sir Launcelot waited not for the dawn, but, his sword gripped in his hand, sprang ashore, and then, right before him, he saw a postern where the gate stood open indeed, but two grisly lions kept the way. And when Sir Launcelot would have rushed upon the great beasts with his sword, it was struck from his hand, and a voice said: \"Ah! Launcelot, ever is thy trust in thy might rather than thy Maker!\" Sore ashamed, Sir Launcelot took his sword and thrust it back into the sheath, and going forward, he passed unhurt through the gateway, the lions that kept it falling back from his path. So without more adventure, Launcelot entered into the castle; and there he saw how every door stood open, save only one, and that was fast barred, nor, with all his force, might he open it. Presently from the chamber within came the sound of a sweet voice in a holy chant, and then in his heart Launcelot knew that he was come to the Holy Grail. So, kneeling humbly, he prayed that to him might be shown some vision of that he sought. Forthwith the door flew open and from the chamber blazed a light such as he had never known before; but when he made to enter, a voice cried: \"Launcelot, forbear,\" and sorrowfully he withdrew. Then where he knelt, far even from the threshold of the wondrous room, he saw a silver table and, on it, covered with red samite, the Holy Grail. At sight of that which he had sought so long, his joy became so great that, unmindful of the warning, he advanced into the room and drew nigh even to the Table itself.

At last, one night-tide, he came to the shores of a great water and there he lay down to sleep; but as he slept, a voice called on him: \"Launcelot, arise, put on thine armour and go on thy way until thou comest to a ship. Into that thou shalt enter.\" Immediately, Sir Launcelot started from his sleep to obey and, riding along the shore, came presently to a ship beached on the strand; no sooner had he entered it, than the ship was launched--how, he might not know. So the ship sailed before the wind for many a day. No mortal was on it, save only Sir Launcelot, yet were all his needs supplied. Then, at last, the ship ran ashore at the foot of a great castle; and it was midnight. Sir Launcelot waited not for the dawn, but, his sword gripped in his hand, sprang ashore, and then, right before him, he saw a postern where the gate stood open indeed, but two grisly lions kept the way. And when Sir Launcelot would have rushed upon the great beasts with his sword, it was struck from his hand, and a voice said: \"Ah! Launcelot, ever is thy trust in thy might rather than thy Maker!\" Sore ashamed, Sir Launcelot took his sword and thrust it back into the sheath, and going forward, he passed unhurt through the gateway, the lions that kept it falling back from his path. So without more adventure, Launcelot entered into the castle; and there he saw how every door stood open, save only one, and that was fast barred, nor, with all his force, might he open it. Presently from the chamber within came the sound of a sweet voice in a holy chant, and then in his heart Launcelot knew that he was come to the Holy Grail.

She fought between modesty and a desire to encourage him. The hours flew, and he had not even sought a secluded corner. She sent away the maid who came with her mother's summons and lingered another moment for the words she felt were trembling on the lips beneath the love-agonized eyes.

His hands were soiled with blood, with dark hideous crimes. And he asked why he had committed such deeds--with all this beauty around him. Why could he not have likened history to these woods where the snow was white. Tomorrow he would do better.</p><p>  And then came the Spirit of Philosophy and like the others he wondered why he had never been under the spell of the Moonbeams before--why had he filled the minds of men with entangled masses of dark thought, instead of teaching them the beauty, the enchantment of a night like this. Tomorrow he would do better.</p><p>  The three Spirits met and talked together. They would go back to the cities and begin anew.

This was in 1853, when peddling was more common in the Western country than it is now, and was attended with considerable danger.  The peddler with his pack traversed the country by all manner of lonely roads, and was compelled to rely upon the country people for hospitality.  This brought him into relation with queer characters, some of whom were not altogether scrupulous in their methods of making a living, murder being an acceptable means to that end.  It occasionally occurred that a peddler with diminished pack and swollen purse would be traced to the lonely dwelling of some rough character and never could be traced beyond.  This was so in the case of “old man Baker,” as he was always called.  (Such names are given in the western “settlements” only to elderly persons who are not esteemed; to the general disrepute of social unworth is affixed the special reproach of age.)  A peddler came to his house and none went away—that is all that anybody knew.</p><p>Seven years later the Rev. Mr. Cummings, a Baptist minister well known in that part of the country, was driving by Baker’s farm one night.  It was not very dark: there was a bit of moon somewhere above the light veil of mist that lay along the earth.  Mr. Cummings, who was at all times a cheerful person, was whistling a tune, which he would occasionally interrupt to speak a word of friendly encouragement to his horse.  As he came to a little bridge across a dry ravine he saw the figure of a man standing upon it, clearly outlined against the gray background of a misty forest.  The man had something strapped on his back and carried a heavy stick—obviously an itinerant peddler.  His attitude had in it a suggestion of abstraction, like that of a sleepwalker.  Mr. Cummings reined in his horse when he arrived in front of him, gave him a pleasant salutation and invited him to a seat in the vehicle—“if you are going my way,” he added.  The man raised his head, looked him full in the face, but neither answered nor made any further movement.  The minister, with good-natured persistence, repeated his invitation.  At this the man threw his right hand forward from his side and pointed downward as he stood on the extreme edge of the bridge.  Mr. Cummings looked past him, over into the ravine, saw nothing unusual and withdrew his eyes to address the man again.  He had disappeared.  The horse, which all this time had been uncommonly restless, gave at the same moment a snort of terror and started to run away.  Before he had regained control of the animal the minister was at the crest of the hill a hundred yards along.  He looked back and saw the figure again, at the same place and in the same attitude as when he had first observed it.  Then for the first time he was conscious of a sense of the supernatural and drove home as rapidly as his willing horse would go.</p><p>On arriving at home he related his adventure to his family, and early the next morning, accompanied by two neighbors, John White Corwell and Abner Raiser, returned to the spot.  They found the body of old man Baker hanging by the neck from one of the beams of the bridge, immediately beneath the spot where the apparition had stood.

Green waves died upon each other, like a cohesive fantasy. Each small wave rose as high as the other and ended in a swan’s neck of white interrogation. Sunlight blinded the water as style dazes the contents of a poem and the blue sky lifted itself to symmetrical stupor. The air fell against one like a soothing religion. The bristling melancholia of pine trees lined the wide river. But Alvin Tor sat in his floating row-boat, reading the Bible. He read the Songs of Solomon, and a sensual pantomime made a taut stage of his face. When not reading the Songs of Solomon he was as staidly poised as a monk’s folded arms. He had borrowed the colours of his life from that spectrum of desire which he called God. Different shades of green leaves were, to him, the playful jealousies of a presence; the tossed colours of birds became the ineffably light gestures of a lost poet.</p><p>His Swedish peasant’s face had singed its dimples in a bit of sophistication but his eyes were undeceived. His heart was a secluded soliloquy transforming the shouts of the world into tinkling surmises. His broad nose and long lips were always at ease and his ruddy skin held the texture of fresh bunting. His eyes knew the unkindled reticence of a rustic boy.</p><p>This man of one mood sat in his floating row-boat, reading the Bible. He reached the mouth of the river and drifted out to sea. The sea was a menacing lethargy of rhythm: green swells sensed his row-boat with dramatic leisure. A sea gull skimmed over the water, like a haphazard adventure. Looking up from his Bible Alvin Tor saw the body of a woman floating beside his boat. With one jerk his face swerved into blankness. The tip of his tongue met his upper lip as though it were a fading rim of reality. The fingers of one hand distressed his flaxen hair.</p><p>The woman floated on her back with infinite abandon. Little ripples of green water died fondling her body. The green swells barely lifting her were great rhythms disturbed by an inert discord. Sunlight, fumbling at her body, relinquished its promiscuous desires and became abashed. Her wet brown hair had a drugged gentility: its short dark curls hugged her head with despondent understanding. Her face had been washed to an imperturbable transparency: it had the whiteness of reclining foam overcast with a twinge of green--the sea had lent her its skin. Her eyes were limply unworried and violated to gray disintegration. In separated bits of outlines the remains of thinly impudent features were slipping from her face. The bloated pity of black and white garments hid her lean body.</p><p>As Alvin Tor watched her, tendrils of peace gradually interfered with the blankness on his face. His lips sustained an unpremeditated repose. A sensitive compassion dropped the sparks of its coming into his eyes. His clothes became a jest upon an inhuman body; the earth of him effortlessly transcended itself in the gesture of his arm flung out to the woman.</p><p>“Impalpable relic of a soul, the spirit you held must have severed its shadow to preserve you forever from the waves,” he said, his face blindfolded with ecstasy, “for you grasp the water with immortal relaxation. You are not a body--you are beauty receding into a resistless seclusion.”</p><p>“Kind fool, musically stifling himself in a row-boat--made kind by the desperate tenderness of a lie--you are serenading the chopped bodies of your emotions,” said the woman.</p><p>Alvin Tor’s face cracked apart and the incredulously hurrying ghost of a child nodded a moment and was snuffed out.</p><p>“Mermaid of haunting despondency, what are you?” he asked.</p><p>“I am the symbol of your emotions,” the woman answered.</p><p>“I made them roses stepped upon by God,” said Alvin Tor.</p><p>“I am the symbol of your emotions,” said the woman.</p><p>Alvin Tor heavily dropped his raised arm, like a man smashing a trumpet. Restless white hands compressed the ruddy broadness of his face. The woman slid into the green swells like exhausted magic. Alvin Tor rowed back to the river.</p><p>A woman lifted the green window-shades in her room and resentfully blinked at the sun-plastered clamours of a street. She turned to the bed upon which another woman reclined.</p><p>“Say, wasn’t that a nutty drunk we had last night?” she said. “Huggin’ a Bible and ravin’ about waves and mermaids and a lot of funny stuff!”</p><p>She dropped the green shade and stood against it a moment in the smouldering gloom of the room. Her blonde hair, though now a bit tangled, still held a lively glow: its long, flowing locks spread around her head in a messy yet energetic aura. Her face had been washed to an imperturbable transparency: it had the whiteness of reclining foam overcast with a twinge of green--the sea had lent her its skin.</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's go through the story step by step to identify any potential continuity errors.", "1.", "**Initial Description of Alvin Tor**: - The story describes Alvin Tor as reading the Bible, sitting in a floating row-boat, and being surrounded by natural scenery.", "2. **Encounter with a Woman**: - Alvin Tor encounters a woman floating in the sea next to his row-boat.", "This is the first time a woman is introduced in the story.", "3. **Dialogue with the Woman**: - The woman speaks to Alvin Tor, revealing herself as a \"symbol of his emotions.\"", "This is consistent with the earlier description of Alvin Tor making his emotions \"roses stepped upon by God.", "\" 4. **Second Mention of a Woman**: - Near the end of the story, another woman is described lifting green window-shades in her room and talking about a previous night with a man who was \"hugging a Bible and raving about waves and mermaids and a lot of funny stuff.", "\" - This woman has blonde hair that \"still held a lively glow,\" and her face is described similarly to the woman Alvin Tor encountered, having \"the whiteness of reclining foam overcast with a twinge of green.\" 5.", "**Comparison of Descriptions**: - The description of the second woman's face matches exactly with the description of the first woman's face.", "This is problematic because it suggests that the same woman is being described twice, which would be a continuity error if they are meant to be different individuals.", "Given the exact matching of descriptions for the two women, it seems likely that the second woman is the same as the first woman, but the context suggests they are separate individuals (one from a dream or memory, and one from reality).", "<contradicted_lines> The second woman's description matches the first woman's description exactly: \"Her face had been washed to an imperturbable transparency: it had the whiteness of reclining foam overcast with a twinge of green--the sea had lent her its skin.", "\" </contradicted_lines>"], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

They did not know each other. He had seen her walking along one of the park paths, and the loneliness of her face stopped him. She read the verse, then gazed at him a few seconds, half amused, half annoyed, then wholly joyous. He read compliance in her eyes.</p><p>\"Rather rude, isn't it?\" he asked. \"But the desperation of loneliness is heavy on my soul.\"</p><p>They sauntered to the gates and boarded a street car, which whirled them, with twenty other people equally though unconsciously lonely, toward the mountain. She did not speak until they were zig-zagging along a bridle path up the mountainside. Then she unfolded the verse and said musingly:</p><p>\"A day of idyl! A year ago I thought that every day would be an idyl.\" And the sweet mouth soured in the churn of memory.</p><p>\"My dear lady,\" he said, \"memories have no place in a day of idyl. Oh, let me teach you how to live, live, live, if only for an hour! Let's sing the song of nature which is happiness--dance the dance of winds which is joy--think the thought of butterflies which is nothing! Oh, there is happiness everywhere, everywhere--even for you and me!\"</p><p>They reached a little hillock where a clump of bushes cast a tempting shadow.</p><p>\"Let's sit down a while,\" she said, pouring water on a rocket.</p><p>For a few minutes they sat in silence. The idyl had not yet begun. From behind them came voices, and a woman's laugh startled the air and the Poet. Nearer came the voices, and the Girl gripped the grasses at her sides. The couple swung jauntily past without noticing them and settled down in the long grass at the foot of the hillock.</p><p>The Poet and the Girl were statues. Their faces were averted. From the long grass came the noise of kisses.</p><p>The sun slipped away. The air was hot and heavy and all around was the silence of premonition. A bird piped fretfully, and a peevish breeze shook the leaves. The amorous couple in the long grass rose.</p><p>\"Say,\" said the man, looking at his watch, \"if we're goin' to see that show we've got to hustle.\"</p><p>And they hurried away.</p><p>The Girl rose, walked a few yards, then stood gazing on the far horizon of departed time. Then she returned.</p><p>\"That was my husband,\" she said.</p><p>The Poet sprang to his feet as though released by a spring.

Now, Lanty had taken a bit of a farm, about six acres; but as there was no house on it, he resolved to build one; and that it might be as comfortable as possible, he selected for the site of it one of those beautiful green circles that are supposed to be the play-ground of the fairies. Lanty was warned against this; but as he was a headstrong man, and not much given to fear, he said he would not change such a pleasant situation for his house to oblige all the fairies in Europe. He accordingly proceeded with the building, which he finished off very neatly; and, as it is usual on these occasions to give one's neighbours and friends a house-warming, so, in compliance with this good and pleasant old custom, Lanty having brought home the wife in the course of the day, got a fiddler and a lot of whisky, and gave those who had come to see him a dance in the evening. This was all very well, and the fun and hilarity were proceeding briskly, when a noise was heard after night had set in, like a crushing and straining of ribs and rafters on the top of the house. The folks assembled all listened, and, without doubt, there was nothing heard but crushing, and heaving, and pushing, and groaning, and panting, as if a thousand little men were engaged in pulling down the roof.</p><p>'Come,' said a voice which spoke in a tone of command, 'work hard: you know we must have Lanty's house down before midnight.'</p><p>This was an unwelcome piece of intelligence to Lanty, who, finding that his enemies were such as he could not cope with, walked out, and addressed them as follows:</p><p>'Gintlemen, I humbly ax yer pardon for buildin' on any place belongin' to you; but if you'll have the civilitude to let me alone this night, I'll begin to pull down and remove the house to-morrow morning.'</p><p>This was followed by a noise like the clapping of a thousand tiny little hands, and a shout of 'Bravo, Lanty! build half-way between the two White-thorns above the boreen'; and after another hearty little shout of exultation, there was a brisk rushing noise, and they were heard no more.</p><p>The story, however, does not end here; for Lanty, when digging the foundation of his new house, found the full of a _kam_[1] of gold: so that in leaving to the fairies their play-ground, he became a richer man than ever he otherwise would have been, had he never come in contact with them at all.</p><p>[Footnote 1: _Kam_--a metal vessel in which the peasantry dip rushlights.]</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to identify any continuity errors.", "1.", "**Initial Setup**: Lanty builds a house on what he believes is a fairy play-ground.", "2. **Conflict**: After the house is built, there is a mysterious noise indicating that the fairies are trying to pull down the house.", "3. **Resolution**: Lanty agrees to move the house and, in doing so, finds a treasure of gold under the foundation.", "Now, let's look for any contradictions: - The story mentions that Lanty built the house on a fairy play-ground.", "This sets up the expectation that the fairies will be upset about the intrusion.", "- The fairies then try to pull down the house, which aligns with the idea that they are angry about the construction.", "- When Lanty agrees to move the house, the fairies allow him to keep the treasure, which is a form of compensation.", "There doesn't seem to be any direct contradiction within the story itself.", "However, the concept of fairies being upset about the construction and then offering a treasure as compensation can be seen as somewhat inconsistent.", "Typically, fairies are portrayed as capricious and often seek revenge rather than offering rewards for appeasement.", "But since the story explicitly states that Lanty found gold and the fairies allowed him to keep it, this is presented as the resolution of the conflict.", "Given the explicit resolution in the story, there is no clear contradiction or inconsistency that violates the established narrative."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

So when the Goody came back and saw that, she fell into such a rage, that she snatched up the little morsel of the cream that was left, and threw it at the fox as he ran off, so that he got a dab of it on the end of his tail, and that’s the reason why the fox has a white tip to his brush.</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to detect any continuity errors.", "1.", "The woman meets a bear and asks if he can be a herdsman.", "The bear responds with \"OW, OW!\" which is not a typical sound a bear would make, but rather sounds like a distress call or pain.", "2.", "The woman meets a wolf and asks if he can be a herdsman.", "The wolf responds with \"UH, UH!\" which again is not a typical sound a wolf would make.", "3.", "The woman meets a fox and asks if he can be a herdsman.", "The fox responds with \"DIL-DAL-HOLOM\", which is a made-up phrase and not a typical sound a fox would make.", "The continuity error seems to lie in the responses given by the bear, the wolf, and the fox, which are not realistic animal sounds.", "<contradicted_lines> “OW, OW!” growled the bear.<br> “UH, UH!” said the Wolf.<br> “DIL-DAL-HOLOM”, sung out the Fox, in such a fine clear voice.", "</contradicted_lines> There are no prior lines in the story that contradict the animal sounds mentioned, as they are all introduced in this context and are part of the story's narrative.", "However, since these sounds are unrealistic for the animals involved, we can consider them as continuity errors in terms of the story's realism.", "Given the context, the story is clearly a fairy tale where animals speak and behave in unusual ways, so the sounds are part of the fantasy element.", "Therefore, there are no contradictions based on the established rules of this particular story."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

With their aid, he overthrew his foes in a great battle near the river Trent; and then he passed with them into their own lands and helped them drive out their enemies. So there was ever great friendship between Arthur and the Kings Ban and Bors, and all their kindred; and afterwards some of the most famous Knights of the Round Table were of that kin.</p><p>Then King Arthur set himself to restore order throughout his kingdom. To all who would submit and amend their evil ways, he showed kindness; but those who persisted in oppression and wrong he removed, putting in their places others who would deal justly with the people. And because the land had become overrun with forest during the days of misrule, he cut roads through the thickets, that no longer wild beasts and men, fiercer than the beasts, should lurk in their gloom, to the harm of the weak and defenceless. Thus it came to pass that soon the peasant ploughed his fields in safety, and where had been wastes, men dwelt again in peace and prosperity.</p><p>Amongst the lesser kings whom Arthur helped to rebuild their towns and restore order, was King Leodegrance of Cameliard. Now Leodegrance had one fair child, his daughter Guenevere; and from the time that first he saw her, Arthur gave her all his love. So he sought counsel of Merlin, his chief adviser. Merlin heard the King sorrowfully, and he said: \"Sir King, when a man's heart is set, he may not change. Yet had it been well if ye had loved another.\"</p><p>So the King sent his knights to Leodegrance, to ask of him his daughter; and Leodegrance consented, rejoicing to wed her to so good and knightly a King. With great pomp, the princess was conducted to Canterbury, and there the King met her, and they two were wed by the Archbishop in the great Cathedral, amid the rejoicings of the people.</p><p>On that same day did Arthur found his Order of the Round Table, the fame of which was to spread throughout Christendom and endure through all time. Now the Round Table had been made for King Uther Pendragon by Merlin, who had meant thereby to set forth plainly to all men the roundness of the earth. After Uther died, King Leodegrance had possessed it; but when Arthur was wed, he sent it to him as a gift, and great was the King's joy at receiving it. One hundred and fifty knights might take their places about it, and for them Merlin made sieges or seats.

We were playing the drama of \"William Tell, the Hero of Switzerland.\" Of course I was William Tell, in spite of Fred Langdon, who wanted to act that character himself. I wouldn't let him, so he withdrew from the company, taking the only bow and arrow we had. I made a cross-bow out of a piece of whalebone, and did very well without him. We had reached that exciting scene where Gessler, the Austrian tyrant, commands Tell to shoot the apple from his son's head. Pepper Whitcomb, who played all the juvenile and women parts, was my son. To guard against mischance, a piece of pasteboard was fastened by a handkerchief over the upper portion of Whitcomb's face, while the arrow to be used was sewed up in a strip of flannel. I was a capital marksman, and the big apple, only two yards distant, turned its russet cheek fairly towards me.</p><p>I can see poor little Pepper now, as he stood without flinching, waiting for me to perform my great feat. I raised the cross-bow amid the breathless silence of the crowded audience,--consisting of seven boys and three girls, exclusive of Kitty Collins, who insisted on paying her way in with a clothes-pin. I raised the cross-bow, I repeat. Twang! went the whipcord; but, alas! instead of hitting the apple, the arrow flew right into Pepper Whitcomb's mouth, which happened to be open at the time, and destroyed my aim.</p><p>I shall never be able to banish that awful moment from my memory. Pepper's roar, expressive of astonishment, indignation, and pain, is still ringing in my ears.

Now there was soon to be a harvest of rye and oats, so the Wise Man said to her, \"When you are getting dinner for the reapers, clear out the shell of a hen's egg and boil some potage in it, and then take it to the door as if you meant it as a dinner for the reapers.

I'd like to paint something on the last leaf that lies open.”</p><p>“No,” said the Fairy; “I must take it just as it is.”</p><p>“I wish that I could look through mine just once,” said Carl; “I have only seen one page at a time, for when the leaf turns over it sticks fast, and I can never open the book at more than one place each day.”</p><p>“You shall look at your book,” said the Fairy, “and Philip, at his.” And she lit for them two little silver lamps, by the light of which they saw the pages as she turned them.</p><p>The boys looked in wonder. Could it be that these were the same fair books she had given them a year ago? Where were the clean, white pages, as pure and beautiful as the snow when it first falls?

They had lived all their lives in a tiny cottage of wattles, thatched with straw, cheerful and content in spite of their poverty.</p><p>As this worthy couple sat dozing by the fireside one evening in the late autumn, two strangers came and begged a shelter for the night. They had to stoop to enter the humble doorway, where the old man welcomed them heartily and bade them rest their weary limbs on the settle before the fire.</p><p>Meanwhile Baucis stirred the embers, blowing them into a flame with dry leaves, and heaped on the fagots to boil the stew-pot. Hanging from the blackened beams was a rusty side of bacon. Philemon cut off a rasher to roast, and, while his guests refreshed themselves with a wash at the rustic trough, he gathered pot-herbs from his patch of garden. Then the old woman, her hands trembling with age, laid the cloth and spread the table.</p><p>It was a frugal meal, but one that hungry wayfarers could well relish. The first course was an omelette of curdled milk and eggs, garnished with radishes and served on rude oaken platters. The cups of turned beechwood were filled with homemade wine from an earthen jug. The second course consisted of dried figs and dates, plums, sweet-smelling apples, and grapes, with a piece of clear, white honeycomb. What made the meal more grateful to the guests was the hearty spirit in which it was offered. Their hosts gave all they had without stint or grudging.</p><p>But all at once something happened which startled and amazed Baucis and Philemon. They poured out wine for their guests, and, lo! each time the pitcher filled itself again to the brim.</p><p>The old couple then knew that their guests were not mere mortals; indeed, they were no other than Jupiter and Mercury come down to earth in the disguise of poor travelers. Being ashamed of their humble entertainment, Philemon hurried out and gave chase to his only goose, intending to kill and roast it. But his guests forbade him, saying:--</p><p>“In mortal shape we have come down, and at a hundred houses asked for lodging and rest. For answer a hundred doors were shut and locked against us. You alone, the poorest of all, have received us gladly and given us of your best. Now it is for us to punish these impious people who treat strangers so churlishly, but you two shall be spared. Only leave your cottage and follow us to yonder mountain-top.”</p><p>So saying, Jupiter and Mercury led the way, and the two old folks hobbled after them. Presently they reached the top of the mountain, and Baucis and Philemon saw all the country round, with villages and people, sinking into a marsh; while their own brick cottage alone was left standing.</p><p>And while they gazed, their cottage was changed into a white temple. The solid brick walls became a facade with marble columns. The tiled roof transformed into a structure of golden tiles. The little garden about their home became a park.</p><p>Then Jupiter, regarding Baucis and Philemon with kindly eyes, said: “Tell me, O good old man and you good wife, what may we do in return for your hospitality?”</p><p>Philemon whispered for a moment with Baucis, and she nodded her approval. “We desire,” he replied, “to be your servants, and to have the care of this temple. One other favor we would ask. From boyhood I have loved only Baucis, and she has lived only for me. Let the selfsame hour take us both away together. Let me never see the tomb of my wife, nor let her suffer the misery of mourning my death.”</p><p>Jupiter and Mercury, pleased with these requests, willingly granted both, and endowed Baucis and Philemon with youth and strength as well. The gods then vanished from their sight, but as long as their lives lasted Baucis and Philemon were the guardians of the white temple that once had been their home.</p><p>And when again old age overtook them, they were standing one day in front of the sacred porch, and Baucis, turning her gaze upon her husband, saw him slowly changing into a gnarled oak tree. And Philemon, as he felt himself rooted to the ground, saw Baucis at the same time turning into a leafy linden.</p><p>And as their faces disappeared behind the green foliage, each cried unto the other, “Farewell, dearest love!” and again, “Dearest love, farewell!” And their human forms were changed to trees and branches.</p><p>And still, if you visit the spot, you may see an oak and a linden tree with branches intertwined.</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to detect any continuity errors.", "1.", "**Initial Setup**: - Baucis and Philemon live in a humble cottage.", "- They are poor but hospitable.", "- They have a goose, a garden, and a small amount of food like bacon, herbs, and some fruits.", "2. **Visitors Arrive**: - Two strangers (later revealed to be Jupiter and Mercury) arrive and are welcomed. - Baucis and Philemon offer a simple but hearty meal. - There's no mention of extra provisions or wealth beyond what they have.", "3. **Revelation of Guests' True Identity**: - The guests reveal they are gods and reward the couple for their hospitality.", "- They transform the cottage into a temple.", "4. *", "*Requests from Baucis and Philemon**: - They request to serve as priests and to die together. - Jupiter and Mercury grant their wishes.", "5.", "**Transformation**: - Both are turned into trees but remain together.", "Now, let's look for any contradictions or inconsistencies: - Initially, the cottage is described as humble, with \"wattles, thatched with straw,\" and having \"a rusty side of bacon\" hanging from the beams.", "This suggests a very modest lifestyle. - When the guests appear, the couple offers them a simple meal consisting of \"omelette of curdled milk and eggs,\" \"homemade wine,\" \"dried figs and dates, plums, sweet-smelling apples, and grapes,\" and \"clear, white honeycomb.\"", "This meal is frugal yet adequate for their modest means.", "- After the transformation, the cottage becomes a white temple with marble columns and golden tiles.", "This sudden change in their living conditions seems to contradict the earlier description of their poverty and lack of resources.", "Let's quote the relevant lines: <contradicted_lines> \"The cottage was changed into a white temple.", "The solid brick walls became a facade with marble columns.", "The tiled roof transformed into a structure of golden tiles.", "The little garden about their home became a park.", "\" </contradicted_lines> The transformation of their humble cottage into a grand temple with marble columns and golden tiles directly contradicts the earlier description of their poverty and modest lifestyle.", "Therefore, there is a continuity error in the story."], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

One day one of the servants, wishing to get some flour from the jar, lifted the lid, when suddenly from the depths of it a huge snake made its appearance. The servant, startled, fell back in great alarm, and then went and told the master what had happened. The master sent his men-slaves and had the jar brought down. They broke it open and let out a huge, awful-looking snake, such as one had never seen before. Several of the servants joined in with clubs and killed the brute. They then piled wood on it and set fire to the whole. Vile fumes arose that filled the house. From the fumes all the people of the place died, leaving no one behind to represent the family. Others who entered the house died also, so that the place became cursed, and was left in desolation. A little later a mysterious fire broke out and burnt up the remaining buildings, leaving only the vacant site.

As the day dawned he saw before him an island, several leagues in extent, and covered with trees like a continual orchard. Though apparently uncultivated it was populous, for the inhabitants were seen issuing from all parts of the woods and running to the shore. They were perfectly naked, and, as they stood gazing at the ships, appeared by their attitudes and gestures to be lost in astonishment.</p><p>Columbus made signals for the ships to cast anchor and the boats to be manned and armed. He entered his own boat, richly attired in scarlet, and holding the royal standard; while Martin Alonzo Pinzon and his brother put off in company in their boats, each with a banner of the enterprise emblazoned with a green cross, having on either side the letters “F.” and “Y.,” the initials of the Castilian monarchs Fernando and Ysabel, surmounted by crowns.</p><p>As he approached the shore, Columbus was struck by the harshness of the landscape and the clear visibility across the barren land. He saw no signs of fruits of an unknown kind upon the trees which overhung the shores.</p><p>On landing he threw himself on his knees, kissed the earth, and returned thanks to God with tears of joy.

She replied: because if it is so, we shall have a long rest. And Azzolino laughed and ordered that she be given and put on a fine skirt which came to her knees, and he made her hold it up and had all the nuts scattered on the floor, and then he made the woman pick them up again one by one and place them in the sack, and then he rewarded her handsomely.</p><p>In Lombardy and the Marches, the pans are called pots [146].

Go and hang him then. But, sire, he is a potter. Therefore I say go and hang him. Sire, we are only saying that he is a potter. Well, I say again that you take him and hang him.</p><p>Then the judge perceived the origin of the misunderstanding. And he explained it, but it was of no avail for Azzolino had said it three times, and the man had to be hung.</p><p>It would take too long to tell how feared he was, and it is within the knowledge of many.</p><p>It is recorded how one day being with the Emperor on horseback with all their followers, the two of them made a challenge which had the finer sword. The Emperor drew his sword from its sheath, and it was magnificently ornamented with gold and precious stones.</p><p>Then said Messer Azzolino: it is very fine, but mine is finer by far.</p><p>And he drew it forth.</p><p>Then six hundred knights who were with him all drew forth theirs.

Lots of fun down thar on that farm of mine, huntin', fishin', and shootin', and other things. Wall, I never shot but one bird in my life, and that wuz a squirrel; yes, sir, a flyin' squirrel.</p><p>I had a feller workin' fer me on the farm last summer, and he was cross-eyed, and I sent him out in the paster to dig a well fer me, and what do you s'pose? Wall he dug it so tarnal all-fired crooked that he fell out of it and sprained his ankel. Then one day I sent him out in the garden to plant some pertaters and some unyuns fer me, and it jist seemed like that feller didn't have good hoss sense. He planted them unyuns and pertaters right alongside of each other, and the unyuns got into the pertaters' eyes and they couldn't see to grow. Oh, yes, lots of fun down home onct in a while. I calculate I've got the funnyest lot of chickens you ever heerd tell on. I've got sixty old hens and they lay an egg every day; but they don't lay any at nite, cos when nite comes every one of them is roosters. I had one old hen, she went into the woodshed and sot down on the ax and tried to hatch-it. I had another one sottin' on a door knob, tryin' to hatch out a house and lot, but she didn't. While she wuz a-sottin' there along cum a rooster, and he sed, \"We're having a little party down behind the barn; will you dance with me this set?\" and she sed, \"No, sir, I'm engaged to his nobs for this set.\" Gosh, I wuz afraid to go out in the barnyard one while, cos one day when I wuz out thar I heerd a hen say to a rooster, \"Thar's that old gray-headed cuss we've bin a-layin' fer.\"</p><p>Guess that's my train; s'pose I'll be headin' to New York now; good-bye; hope to see you all soon, maybe even in New York, if you kin, ev'ry one of ye; think about comin' down about apple-butter time and jist butt in--good bye. -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story line by line to detect any continuity errors.", "1.", "The narrator mentions having worked with a cross-eyed man who dug a well crookedly.", "2.", "Later, the narrator talks about sending the same man to plant potatoes and onions, which leads to a contradiction because the man's poor judgment (digging the well crookedly) doesn't logically lead to planting crops incorrectly.", "<contradicted_lines> I sent him out in the garden to plant some pertaters and some unyuns fer me, and it jist seemed like that feller didn't have good hoss sense.", "He planted them unyuns and pertaters right alongside of each other, and the unyuns got into the pertaters' eyes and they couldn't see to grow.", "</contradicted_lines> The earlier statement about the man being cross-eyed does not logically lead to him planting the crops incorrectly.", "It’s more likely that the narrator meant to describe a different incident or a different person."], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

Wall now I must say I didn't see much ball playin' of any kind. All I got to see wuz about fifty or sixty ambulances, and I think about that many surgons and phisicians. Wall, from what I could see of the game I calculate they needed all of them. I saw one feller and 'bout fifty others had him down, and it jist looked as though they wuz all trying to get a kick at him. They had a half back and a quarter back; I suppose when they got through with that feller he wuz a hump back. Anyhow, if that's what they call foot ball playin', your Uncle Josh don't want any foot ball in his'n.</p><p>I never played but one game of ball in my life that I kin remember on, and don't believe that I ever will forgit that. You see it wuz along in the spring time of the yeer, and the weather wuz purty warm and sunshiny, and the boys sed to me, \"Uncle, we'd like to have you help us play a game of base ball.\" I sed, \"Boys, I'm gittin' a little too old fer those kinds of passtimes, but I'll help you play one game, I'll be durned if I don't.\" Wall, we got out in the paster and wuz gittin' ready to play; we got the bases and bats put around in thar places, and a buckit of drinkin' water up in the fence corner, whar we could get a drink when we wanted it. We didn't have any bleachers, but we had thirty or forty hogs, and they wuz the best rooters you ever seen; jist then I happened to look around and thar wuz the biggest billy goat I ever saw in all my life. You ought to seen the boys a-gittin' out of the paster; I would hav got out too, but I got stuck in the fence. Wall, you ought to hav seen that billy goat a-gittin' me through the fence. He didn't git me all the way through, cos I wuz half way through when he got thar; but he got the last half through. I didn't make any home run, but I wuz the only feller what had a score of the game; I couldn't see the score, but I had it. Every time I'd go to sot down I knowed jist exactly how the game stood.</p><p>They hav a good many new fangled games now, but when they git anything that can beet a game of base ball with a billy goat fer a battery, durned if I don't want to see it.</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to detect any continuity errors.", "1.", "The narrator mentions watching a football game in New York.", "2.", "In the same paragraph, he describes seeing many ambulances and medical personnel, suggesting something went very wrong during the game.", "3.", "The narrator then shifts to describing a baseball game he played in the past, mentioning warm, sunny weather, and having hogs as spectators.", "4.", "He talks about a billy goat getting him through a fence during the game.", "5.", "The story concludes by comparing modern games to baseball, emphasizing that no game can beat baseball with a billy goat as a player.", "There does not seem to be any direct contradiction between the descriptions of the football game and the baseball game.", "However, the baseball game described involves a billy goat, which is not typically associated with baseball.", "This might be considered a stylistic choice rather than a continuity error.", "Given the context and the narrative style, the story does not contain a continuity error where details contradict each other."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

The old councilor, who had had three orders given him in vain for keeping quiet, asserted that the Leapfrog was a prophet, for that one could see on his back whether the coming winter was to be severe or mild, which is more than one can see on the back of the man who writes the almanac.</p><p>\"I say nothing for the present,\" exclaimed the King; \"yet I have my own opinion, for I observe everything.\"</p><p>And now the match began. The Flea jumped so high that no one could see what had become of him; and so they insisted that he had not jumped at all--which was disgraceful after all the fuss he had made.</p><p>The Grasshopper jumped only half as high; but he leaped into the King's face, who was disgusted by his rudeness.</p><p>The Leapfrog stood for a long time, as if lost in thought; people began to think he would not jump at all.</p><p>\"I'm afraid he is ill!\" said the dog and he went to snuff at him again; when lo! he suddenly made a sideways jump into the lap of the princess, who sat close by on a little golden stool.</p><p>\"There is nothing higher than my daughter,\" said the King; \"therefore to bound into her lap is the highest jump that can be made. Only one of good understanding would ever have thought of that. Thus the Frog has shown that he has sense. He has brains in his head, that he has.\"</p><p>And so he won the princess.</p><p>\"I jumped the highest, for all that,\" said the Flea; \"but it's all the same to me. The princess may have the stiff-legged, slimy creature, if she likes. In this world merit seldom meets its reward. Dullness and heaviness win the day. I am too light and airy for a stupid world.\"</p><p>And so the Flea went into foreign service.</p><p>The Grasshopper sat without on a green bank and reflected on the world and its ways; and he too said, \"Yes, dullness and heaviness win the day; a fine exterior is what people care for nowadays.\" And then he began to sing in his own peculiar way--and it is from his song that we have taken this little piece of history, which may very possibly be all untrue, although it does stand printed here in black and white.</p><p> </p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to detect any continuity errors.", "1. **Introduction of Characters and Setting:** - The Flea, the Grasshopper, and the Leapfrog are introduced.", "- The Flea is described as having noble blood and being accustomed to the society of man. -", "The Grasshopper is described as wearing a green uniform by right of birth and coming from an ancient Egyptian family. -", "The Leapfrog is mentioned but not described in detail.", "2. **The Competition:** - The Flea jumps so high that no one can see him, leading to accusations that he did not jump.", "- The Grasshopper jumps half as high but into the King's face, causing rudeness.", "- The Leapfrog makes a sideways jump into the lap of the princess, winning the competition.", "3. **Conclusion:** - The Flea leaves for foreign service.", "- The Grasshopper reflects on the world and its ways, agreeing that dullness and heaviness win the day.", "Now, let's look for any contradictions or inconsistencies: - **Flea’s Nobility and Manners:** - The Flea is described as having noble blood and being accustomed to the society of man. -", "Later, the Flea is portrayed as someone who thinks his merit is not recognized and leaves for foreign service, implying he is not satisfied with the outcome. - **Grasshopper’s Background:** - The Grasshopper is described as coming from an ancient Egyptian family and wearing a green uniform by right of birth. - There is no mention of the Grasshopper leaving the competition or expressing dissatisfaction with the outcome. - **Leapfrog’s Description:** - The Leapfrog is mentioned but not described in detail.", "His background is not provided. -", "The Leapfrog wins the princess by making a sideways jump into her lap.", "After careful analysis, there are no clear contradictions or inconsistencies between the descriptions of the characters and their actions in the story.", "Each character's actions and statements align with their initial descriptions.", "Therefore, there is no continuity error in the provided story."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

But the Blockhead said: 'Leave the little creatures alone; I will not allow you to disturb them.'</p><p>Then they went on further till they came to a lake, in which a great many ducks were swimming about.

I will not let you burn them.'</p><p>At last the three Brothers came to a castle, where the stables were full of stone horses, but not a soul was to be seen. They went through all the rooms till they came to a door quite at the end, fastened with three bolts. In the middle of the door was a lattice, through which one could see into the room.</p><p>There they saw a little grey Man sitting at a table.

He said not a word, but led them to a richly-spread table, and when they had eaten and drunk, he took them each to a bedroom.</p><p>The next morning the little grey Man came to the eldest Prince, beckoned, and led him to a stone tablet whereon were inscribed three tasks by means of which the castle should be freed from enchantment.</p><p>This was the first task: In the wood, under the moss, lay the Princesses' pearls, a thousand in number. These had all to be found, and if at sunset a single one were missing, the seeker was turned to stone.</p><p>The eldest went away, and searched all day, but when evening came, he had only found the first hundred, and it happened as the inscription foretold. He was turned to stone.</p><p>The next day the second Brother undertook the quest; but he fared no better than the first, for he only found two hundred pearls, and he too was turned to stone.</p><p>At last came the Blockhead's turn; he searched in the moss, but the pearls were hard to find, and he got on but slowly.</p><p>Then he sat down on a rock and cried, and as he was sitting there, the Termite Queen, whose life he had saved, came up with five thousand termites, and it was not long before the little creatures had found all the pearls and laid them in a heap.</p><p>Now the second task was to get the key of the Princesses' room out of the lake.</p><p>When the Blockhead came to the lake, the ducks he had once saved, swam up, dived, and brought up the key from the depths.</p><p>But the third task was the hardest. The Prince had to find out which was the youngest and most charming of the Princesses while they were asleep.</p><p>They were exactly alike, and could not be distinguished in any way, except that before going to sleep each had eaten a different kind of sweet. The eldest a piece of sugar, the second a little syrup, and the third a spoonful of honey.</p><p>Then the Queen of the Bees, whom the Blockhead had saved from burning, came and tried the lips of all three. Finally, she settled on the mouth of the one who had eaten the honey, and so the Prince recognised the right one.</p><p>Then the charm was broken and everything in the castle was set free, and those who had been turned to stone took human form again.</p><p>And the Blockhead married the youngest and sweetest Princess, and became King after her father's death, while his two Brothers married the other sisters.</p><p>[Illustration: The Three Sleeping Princesses.]</p><p>[Illustration: {The Ducks, which he had once saved, dived and brought up the key from the depths.}] -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story line by line to detect any continuity errors.", "1.", "\"The two elder Princes wanted to disturb it, to see how the little ants crept away, carrying their eggs.\" 2.", "\"But the Blockhead said: 'Leave the little creatures alone; I will not allow you to disturb them.'", "\" 3.", "\"Then they went on further till they came to a lake, in which a great many ducks were swimming about.", "The two wanted to catch and roast a pair.\" 4.", "\"But the Blockhead would not allow it, and said: 'Leave the creatures alone.", "You shall not kill them.'", "\" 5.", "\"At last they came to a bee's nest, containing such a quantity of honey that it flowed round the trunk of the tree.", "\" 6.", "\"The two Princes wanted to set fire to the tree, and suffocate the bees, so as to remove the honey.", "\" 7.", "\"But the Blockhead stopped them again, and said: 'Leave the creatures alone.", "I will not let you burn them.'", "\" From the above, we can see that the Blockhead consistently stops the Princes from harming animals or insects.", "This sets a pattern that the Blockhead cares about the well-being of creatures. 8.", "\"Then the second task was to get the key of the Princesses' room out of the lake.", "\" 9.", "\"When the Blockhead came to the lake, the ducks he had once saved, swam up, dived, and brought up the key from the depths.", "\" This line introduces a continuity error because the story previously states that the Blockhead saved the ducks from being killed by the Princes, not that he saved them from another situation.", "There is no prior mention of the Blockhead saving the ducks from drowning or any other danger at the lake.", "<contradicted_lines> \"The two wanted to catch and roast a pair.", "But the Blockhead would not allow it, and said: 'Leave the creatures alone.", "You shall not kill them.'", "\" \"When the Blockhead came to the lake, the ducks he had once saved, swam up, dived, and brought up the key from the depths.", "\" </contradicted_lines>"], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

She would like to have slept for another three hours at least. But no, every morning at almost precisely the same time, at half-past four, she was wide awake. For—nowadays, again—she woke always in the same way, with a slight start, a small shock, lifting her head from the pillow with a quick glance as if she fancied someone had called her, or as if she were trying to remember for certain whether this was the same wallpaper, the same window she had seen last night before Warner switched off the light.... Then the small, silvery head pressed the white pillow again and just for a moment, before the agony of lying awake began, old Mrs. Travers was happy. Her heart quietened down, she breathed deeply, she even smiled. Yet once more the tide of darkness had risen, had floated her, had carried her away; and once more it had ebbed, it had withdrawn, casting her up where it had found her, shut in by the same wallpaper, stared at by the same window—still safe—still _there_!</p><p>Now the church clock sounded from outside, slow, languid, faint, as if it chimed the half hour in its sleep. She felt under the pillow for her watch; yes, it said the same. Half-past four. Just the perfect time to start the day, she thought. She moved her legs restlessly, not out of discomfort, but out of an eagerness to begin. And, staring at the prim, severe face of the watch, it seemed to her that the hands—the minute hand especially—knew that she was watching them and held back—just a very little—on purpose.... Very strange, she had never got over the feeling that watch hated her. It had been Henry’s. Twenty years ago, when standing by poor Henry’s bed, she had taken it into her hands for the first time and wound it, it had felt cold and heavy. And two days later, when she undid a hook of her crape bodice and thrust it inside, it had lain in her bosom like a stone.... It had never felt at home there. Its place was—ticking, keeping perfect time, against Henry’s firm ribs. It had never trusted her, just as he had never trusted her in those ways. And on the rare occasions when she had forgotten to wind it, she had felt a pang of almost terror, and she had murmured as she fitted the little key: “Forgive me, Henry!”</p><p>Old Mrs. Travers sighed, and pushed the watch under the pillow again. It seemed to her that lately this feeling that it hated her had become more definite.... Perhaps that was because she looked at it so often, especially now that she was away from home. Foreign clocks never go. They are always stopped at twenty minutes to two. Twenty minutes to two! Such an unpleasant time, neither one thing nor the other. If one arrived anywhere lunch was over and it was too early to expect a cup of tea.... But she mustn’t begin thinking about tea. Old Mrs. Travers sat up in the bed, and like a content baby, she lifted her arms and let them fall on the eiderdown.</p><p>The room was gay with morning light. The big French window on to the balcony was open and the palm outside flung its quivering spider-like shadow over the bedroom walls. Although their hotel did not face the front, at this early hour you could smell the sea, you could hear it breathing, and flying high on golden wings sea-gulls skimmed past. How peaceful the sky looked, as though it was tenderly smiling! Far away—far away from this satin-stripe wallpaper, the glass-covered table, the yellow brocade sofa and chairs, and the mirrors that showed you your side view, your back view, your three-quarters view as well.</p><p>Ernestine had been enthusiastic about this room.</p><p>“It’s just the very room for you, Mother! So bright and attractive and non-depressing! With a balcony, too, so that on wet days you can still have your chair outside and look at those lovely palms. And Gladys can have the little room adjoining, which makes it so beautifully easy for Warner to keep her eye on you both.... You couldn’t have a nicer room, could you, Mother? I can’t get over that sweet balcony! So nice for Gladys! Cecil and I haven’t got one at all....”</p><p>But all the same, in spite of Ernestine, she never sat on that balcony. For some strange reason that she couldn’t explain she hated looking at palms. Nasty foreign things, she called them in her mind.

She would like to have slept for another three hours at least. But no, every morning at almost precisely the same time, at half-past four, she was wide awake. For—nowadays, again—she woke always in the same way, with a slight start, a small shock, lifting her head from the pillow with a quick glance as if she fancied someone had called her, or as if she were trying to remember for certain whether this was the same wallpaper, the same window she had seen last night before Warner switched off the light.... Then the small, silvery head pressed the white pillow again and just for a moment, before the agony of lying awake began, old Mrs. Travers was happy. Her heart quietened down, she breathed deeply, she even smiled. Yet once more the tide of darkness had risen, had floated her, had carried her away; and once more it had ebbed, it had withdrawn, casting her up where it had found her, shut in by the same wallpaper, stared at by the same window—still safe—still _there_!</p><p>Now the church clock sounded from outside, slow, languid, faint, as if it chimed the half hour in its sleep. She felt under the pillow for her watch; yes, it said the same. Half-past four. Just the perfect time to start the day, she thought. She moved her legs restlessly, not out of discomfort, but out of an eagerness to begin. And, staring at the prim, severe face of the watch, it seemed to her that the hands—the minute hand especially—knew that she was watching them and held back—just a very little—on purpose.... Very strange, she had never got over the feeling that watch hated her. It had been Henry’s. Twenty years ago, when standing by poor Henry’s bed, she had taken it into her hands for the first time and wound it, it had felt cold and heavy. And two days later, when she undid a hook of her crape bodice and thrust it inside, it had lain in her bosom like a stone.... It had never felt at home there. Its place was—ticking, keeping perfect time, against Henry’s firm ribs. It had never trusted her, just as he had never trusted her in those ways. And on the rare occasions when she had forgotten to wind it, she had felt a pang of almost terror, and she had murmured as she fitted the little key: “Forgive me, Henry!”</p><p>Old Mrs. Travers sighed, and pushed the watch under the pillow again. It seemed to her that lately this feeling that it hated her had become more definite.... Perhaps that was because she looked at it so often, especially now that she was away from home. Foreign clocks never go. They are always stopped at twenty minutes to two. Twenty minutes to two! Such an unpleasant time, neither one thing nor the other. If one arrived anywhere lunch was over and it was too early to expect a cup of tea.... But she mustn’t begin thinking about tea. Old Mrs. Travers sat up in the bed, and like a content baby, she lifted her arms and let them fall on the eiderdown.</p><p>The room was gay with morning light. The big French window on to the balcony was open and the palm outside flung its quivering spider-like shadow over the bedroom walls. Although their hotel did not face the front, at this early hour you could smell the sea, you could hear it breathing, and flying high on golden wings sea-gulls skimmed past. How peaceful the sky looked, as though it was tenderly smiling! Far away—far away from this satin-stripe wallpaper, the glass-covered table, the yellow brocade sofa and chairs, and the mirrors that showed you your side view, your back view, your three-quarters view as well.</p><p>Ernestine had been enthusiastic about this room.</p><p>“It’s just the very room for you, Mother! So bright and attractive and non-depressing! With a balcony, too, so that on wet days you can still have your chair outside and look at those lovely palms. And Gladys can have the little room adjoining, which makes it so beautifully easy for Warner to keep her eye on you both.... You couldn’t have a nicer room, could you, Mother? I can’t get over that sweet balcony! So nice for Gladys! Cecil and I haven’t got one at all....”</p><p>But all the same, in spite of Ernestine, she never sat on that balcony. For some strange reason that she couldn’t explain she hated looking at palms. Nasty foreign things, she called them in her mind. When they were still they drooped, they looked draggled like immense untidy birds, and when they moved, they reminded her always of spiders. Why did they never look just natural and peaceful and shady like English trees? Why were they forever writhing and twisting or standing sullen?

The girl, as she grew to womanhood, had a very bad time of it, as all the housework fell upon her shoulders. She had to cook her father's food and carry it to him in the fields; to draw water for the cattle and look after them, besides many other things which took up her time and strength.</p><p>So she invoked the aid of the Gods.</p><p>Next time she went to draw water from the well, which was a very deep one, and required a long, long string for the bucket, she looked in, and lo! the water had risen to the top, and was almost overflowing, so that there was no need to draw any; and her father's cattle stood round and drank their fill.</p><p>Then she filled her chattie with water, and enjoyed a bath in the sunshine.</p><p>After a time the water sank to its usual level. Thus far all was well, but her father noticed how quickly the cattle had been watered, and how soon his daughter returned home: also he missed the long rope which she always carried on her arm. He began to suspect that some unknown man, a stranger to himself, used to help her, and determined to watch.</p><p>A great fig tree grew beside the well; and one day he concealed himself in its branches.</p><p>As usual, his daughter came with the cattle, and all happened as before. He was struck with wonder and amazement at what he saw.</p><p>Just as the girl was about to take her usual bath, she looked up and saw him.</p><p>In a moment she felt that he had suspected her of some evil. \"Father,\" cried she, \"why do you look with an evil eye on your child? Do you not believe that the Gods have helped her?\"</p><p>But before her father could reply, she sank down to the bottom of the well with the water and never rose again, for the outraged Gods took her to themselves; and, in token of their displeasure, the well was cleft from top to bottom, and hillocks formed on either side.

In it are iron pickets to prevent people's entering or departing by that way.</p><p>On a certain afternoon when this military officer was taking a walk, a great snake was seen making its way by means of the Water Gate. The snake's head had already passed between the bars, but its body, being larger, could not get through, so there it was held fast. The soldier drew an arrow, and, fitting it into the string, shot the snake in the head. Its head being fatally injured, the creature died. The archer then drew it out, pounded it into a pulp, and left it.</p><p>A little time later the man's wife conceived and bore a son. From the first the child was afraid of its father, and when it saw him it used to cry and seem greatly frightened. As it grew it hated the sight of its father more and more. The man became suspicious of this, and so, instead of loving his son, he grew to dislike him.</p><p>On a certain day, when there were just the two of them in the room, the officer lay down to have a midday siesta, covering his face with his sleeve, but all the while keeping his eye on the boy to see what he would do. The child glared at his father, and thinking him asleep, got a knife and made a thrust at him. The man jumped, grabbed the knife, and then with a club gave the boy a blow that left him dead on the spot. He pounded him into a pulp, left him and went away. The mother, however, in tears, covered the little form with a quilt and prepared for its burial. In a little the quilt began to move, and she in alarm raised it to see what had happened, when lo! beneath it the child was gone and there lay coiled a huge snake instead. The mother jumped back in fear, left the room and did not again enter.</p><p>When evening came the husband returned and heard the dreadful story from his wife. He went in and looked, and now all had metamorphosed into a huge snake. He said to the snake, \"You and I were originally not enemies, I therefore did wrong in shooting you as I did; but your intention to take revenge through becoming my son was a horrible deed. Such a thing as this is proof that my suspicions of you were right and just. You became my son in order to kill me, your father; why, therefore, should I not in my turn kill you?

It was called the “Forty-Five” banquet in honor of the boys who had not returned.   Captain Jack Fuller proposed to save one bottle of vintage, the seal   of which should be broken when in the course of years only two of   the sixty heroes remained. On their final reunion they would drink a   toast to “Forty-Five.”</p><p>  _Steps toward Dramatic Climax_: Captain Jack was the first to join   Forty-Five. He left a son, who grew up, married, and died, leaving a   son, young Jack Fuller.</p><p>  In 1910, eleven heroes are living; by August 16, 1912, the ranks have   dwindled to four old men. On August 17, 1912, Jack Fuller, grandson   of Captain Jack of Civil War fame, in a drunken fit accidentally   kills his baby. Sobered by the tragedy, he promises reformation.   Succeeding months witness his hard struggle. He wishes, as a final   safeguard, to join the National Guardsmen, but his wife, Betty,   begs him to stay with her--she cannot bear alone the memories. Jack   raises a company, becomes their captain, and drills them as Fuller’s   Fire-eaters. (The Mexican trouble motivates this step.) In August,   1916, three of the Forty-Five are left: Henry Weston, Uncle Joe   Fodder, and Wilber Nieson. In February, 1917, the United States   severs relations with Germany. In July, half of Fuller’s Fire-eaters have been called upon to make up the Paris quota. Jack’s name has not been drawn; but he wishes to enlist, the more so as his men will enlist in a body, not waiting for the draft. Betty implores him to remain; as she breaks down physically, he is torn between love and duty. Wilber Nieson and Henry Weston die. Only Uncle Joe is left; the toast cannot be pledged, after all, as planned.</p><p>  Jack makes up his mind to enlist with his whole Company--Minor   Climax. A dinner is proposed for them in place of the old reunion.   Hundreds of Parisians gather; the largest assembly hall obtainable   is crowded. Sam Hod, editor, is toastmaster by virtue of having   three sons in the Fire-eaters. Uncle Joe Fodder sits at his right.   Captain Jack Fuller at his left. Hod announces that Uncle Joe has   requested that the toast to Forty-Five be given under the present   circumstances. Uncle Joe offers a toast to Captain Jack Fuller and   his posterity.</p><p>  _Dramatic Climax_: Jack’s glass is raised; as he hears the words of   Uncle Joe, he sees his wife’s face. He pours out the wine and makes   his toast with water.</p><p>  _Climax of Action_: Betty sends Jack away--with a smile--and she goes   to work at the box factory.</p><p>DETAILS. Is there a constant struggle for one character, or does it shift from Jack to Betty?</p><p>Is there, accordingly, a stronger or a weaker effect? Is the action unified?</p><p>Did you find the time element confusing or anywhere difficult to follow?</p><p>What details mark the action as belonging particularly to Vermont?</p><p>How many themes do you find in the narrative? Are they brought into essential harmony? What purpose of the author interests you most? What does the author mean to convey in the recognition of Sam Hod and others that Jack’s toast is almost identical with his grandfather’s?</p><p>What do you think of the introduction and the emphasis on the wine? How does the following statement heighten interest?--“that liquor was consumed in the pledging of a toast.”</p><p>Why does the author add so long a conclusion after the story action has been completed? Is he wise to give the final place of emphasis to the sentence, “All over America her name is legion”?

When we came to Mullingar the canal ended, and I began to walk, and stiff and fatigued I was after the slowness. I had some friends with me, and now and then we walked, now and then we rode in a cart. So on till we saw some girls milking a cow, and stopped to joke with them. After a while we asked them for a drink of milk. 'We have nothing to put it in here,' they said, 'but come to the house with us.' We went home with them and sat round the fire talking. After a while the others went, and left me, loath to stir from the good fire. I asked the girls for something to eat. There was a pot on the fire, and they took the meat out and put it on a plate and told me to eat only the meat that came from the head. When I had eaten, the girls went out and I did not see them again.</p><p>It grew darker and darker, and there I still sat, loath as ever to leave the good fire; and after a while two men came in, carrying between them a corpse. When I saw them, the girls saw my fear and stayed close by. Says one to the other, 'Who'll turn the spit?' Says the other, 'Michael Hart, come out of that and turn the meat!' I came out in a tremble and began turning the spit. 'Michael Hart,' says the one who spoke first, 'if you let it burn we will have to put you on the spit instead,' and on that they went out. I sat there trembling and turning the corpse until midnight.
