Wojak was a burly, bearded fellow. These winter days pleased him. He liked the tingle that came with marching in the cold air. He liked the dull, rhythmic \"scruff\" of the hundreds of feet as the regiment swung along, welded by its months of marching into a living unity.</p><p>This was his own country they were marching through. His homestead lay not twenty miles away, near this very road. As he trudged along thoughts of Sophy and little Stephan kept slipping into his mind.</p><p>At the crest of the hill the regiment came to a halt. Back from the road, half hidden in trees that were cut sharp and black against the snow and the sky, stood the ruin of a house.</p><p>\"Just so stands my house,\" thought Wojak. \"Behind, among the trees, should be the pigsty to the left, the stable to the right.\"</p><p>He turned and waded through the newly fallen snow toward the dwelling. Charred beams at one end showed where a fire had been checked by the snowfall. In the yard beneath the fluffy new snow the old layer had evidently been tramped. Behind the house he found the pigsty and the stable.</p><p>\"But the stable is bigger than mine,\" he murmured.</p><p>He looked in. A pile of hay was in the corner, and on it lay some rags. The stable was so dark that Wojak thought he saw a child lying there. He went over to the corner. On the hay was a yellow head, the round cheeks streaked with tears. The child was sleeping, but its breath came in little sobs. With clumsy gentleness the soldier picked the baby up.</p><p>\"Stephan had curls like that,\" he whispered.</p><p>As he stepped out into the light the child awoke. A chubby arm slipped about the burly neck, and the blue eyes looked at him with the beginning of a smile. But in a moment the fact that this was not father, but a strange man, came over the baby, and he began to sob, not angrily, but with a worn anguish that gripped Wojak's heart.</p><p>The company was falling in after the halt when he came to the road. The curly head lay close to his bearded face, and a great clumsy hand protected the little body.</p><p>\"Where did you get that, Wojak?\" growled the lieutenant, staring blankly at the sorrowful little bundle. \"Leave the kid and fall in,\" he commanded. \"There's no time for nonsense on this march.\"</p><p>Wojak started to protest, but the habit of obedience was too strong. Sullenly he stood the baby in the snow and took his place in the ranks. The child's sobs turned to a heartbroken wail.</p><p>\"Forward, march!\" commanded the officer, and the company moved away down the road. Wojak looked back and saw the tiny arms stretched out after him while snowflakes settled on the yellow head. Long after the hilltop was hidden in swirling snow he seemed to see them and to hear the wail of the orphaned baby.</p><p>                   *       *       *       *       *</p><p>The sun was setting when the army bivouacked four miles from Wojak's farm. The orders were that no leaves of absence should be granted; but he knew the sentinel on guard, and home was too near to be left unseen for another four months.</p><p>The stars were glittering from an all but clear sky when he slipped silently through the lines and started down the familiar roads toward Sophy and Stephan. Four months was a terrible length of time. The passage of armies had marked the country. The great tree by the cottage of Ivanovicz had been shattered by a shell and had crashed through the roof. Jablonowski's barns had been burned. The windows of the church at the corners were shattered and a great hole had been shot in the steeple. Wojak walked faster, and a twinge of anxiety came over him as he entered the lane that led up to his barnyard. His heart stopped: the thatch of the stable had been burned and only the walls were standing. His eyes strained for a glimpse of the house. It was not there. A few charred beams marked the place where his home had stood.</p><p>He ran nearer. Snow had covered everything. Beside the place where the door had been was a white mound with a stick standing in the earth at its head. To the stick was nailed a little shoe. Wojak seized it with shaking hands.</p><p>\"Stephan!\" he choked. \"My little Stephan!\"</p><p>After a while he looked up. Looming above him was a man on horseback who had ridden up unheard through the muffling snow.</p><p>\"You are under arrest,\" said the voice of the lieutenant.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to identify any continuity errors.", "1.", "**Initial Setup**: - Wojak is marching with his regiment through his own country.", "- He thinks about his home and family (Sophy and little Stephan).", "2. **Encounter with Ruin**: - At the crest of the hill, the regiment stops.", "- Wojak recognizes the ruined house as his own. -", "He finds the pigsty and stable behind the house.", "3. **Discovery of the Baby**: - The stable is bigger than he remembered. -", "Inside the stable, he finds a sleeping baby with yellow hair and round cheeks. -", "He believes the baby might be his son Stephan. - The baby starts crying when he realizes it’s not the father.", "4.", "**Military Intervention**: - The lieutenant orders Wojak to leave the baby and join the ranks.", "- Wojak reluctantly places the baby in the snow and joins the company.", "5. **March Continues**: - The company moves away, and Wojak watches the child being left behind.", "6.", "**Arrival at Home**: - Four months later, Wojak returns home.", "- He finds his home has been destroyed.", "- A white mound with a stick and a shoe indicates his son Stephan died.", "Now, let's check if there's any contradiction: - **Size of Stable**: - Initially, Wojak remembers the stable as smaller (\"the stable is bigger than mine\"). -", "Later, he finds the stable with a pile of hay and rags inside, which aligns with a smaller stable (as he remembers it). -", "**Baby’s Identity**: - Wojak initially thinks the baby might be his son Stephan based on physical resemblance. - When he finds the shoe of his son Stephan, it confirms that the baby was indeed his son.", "Given the analysis, there are no contradictions between the descriptions of the stable size or the identity of the baby.", "The story logically progresses without any discontinuities."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

From the county jail where he had been confined to await his trial he had escaped by knocking down his jailer with an iron bar, robbing him of his keys and, opening the outer door, walking out into the night.  The jailer being unarmed, Brower got no weapon with which to defend his recovered liberty.  As soon as he was out of the town he had the folly to enter a forest; this was many years ago, when that region was wilder than it is now.</p><p>The night was pretty dark, with neither moon nor stars visible, and as Brower had never dwelt thereabout, and knew nothing of the lay of the land, he was, naturally, not long in losing himself.  He could not have said if he were getting farther away from the town or going back to it—a most important matter to Orrin Brower.  He knew that in either case a posse of citizens with a pack of bloodhounds would soon be on his track and his chance of escape was very slender; but he did not wish to assist in his own pursuit.  Even an added hour of freedom was worth having.</p><p>Suddenly he emerged from the forest into an old road, and there before him saw, clearly under the moonlight, the figure of a man, motionless in the gloom.  It was too late to retreat: the fugitive felt that at the first movement back toward the wood he would be, as he afterward explained, “filled with buckshot.”  So the two stood there like trees, Brower nearly suffocated by the activity of his own heart; the other—the emotions of the other are not recorded.</p><p>A moment later—it may have been an hour—the moon continued to shine brightly, and the hunted man saw that visible embodiment of Law lift an arm and point significantly toward and beyond him.  He understood. Turning his back to his captor, he walked submissively away in the direction indicated, looking to neither the right nor the left; hardly daring to breathe, his head and back actually aching with a prophecy of buckshot.</p><p>Brower was as courageous a criminal as ever lived to be hanged; that was shown by the conditions of awful personal peril in which he had coolly killed his brother-in-law.  It is needless to relate them here; they came out at his trial, and the revelation of his calmness in confronting them came near to saving his neck.  But what would you have?—when a brave man is beaten, he submits.</p><p>So they pursued their journey jailward along the old road through the woods.  Only once did Brower venture a turn of the head: just once, when he was in deep shadow and he knew that the other was in moonlight, he looked backward.  His captor was Burton Duff, the jailer, as white as death and bearing upon his brow the livid mark of the iron bar.  Orrin Brower had no further curiosity.</p><p>Eventually they entered the town, which was all alight, but deserted; only the women and children remained, and they were off the streets. Straight toward the jail the criminal held his way.

She was as nimble with her fingers as Calypso, that Nymph who kept Odysseus for seven years in her enchanted island. She was as untiring as Penelope, the hero's wife, who wove day after day while she watched for his return. Day in and day out, Arachne wove too. The very Nymphs would gather about her loom, Naiads from the water and Dryads from the trees.</p><p>“Maiden,” they would say, shaking the leaves or the foam from their hair, in wonder, “Pallas Athena must have taught you!”</p><p>But this did not please Arachne. She would not acknowledge herself a debtor, even to that goddess who protected all household arts, and by whose grace alone one had any skill in them.</p><p>“I learned not of Athena,” said she. “If she can weave better, let her come and try.”</p><p>The Nymphs shivered at this, and an aged woman, who was looking on, turned to Arachne.</p><p>“Be more heedful of your words, my daughter,” said she. “The goddess may pardon you if you ask forgiveness, but do not strive for honors with the immortals.”</p><p>Arachne broke her thread, and the shuttle stopped humming.</p><p>“Keep your counsel,” she said. “I fear not Athena; no, nor any one else.”</p><p>As she frowned at the old woman, she was amazed to see her change suddenly into one tall, majestic, beautiful,--a maiden of gray eyes and golden hair, crowned with a golden helmet. It was Athena herself.</p><p>The bystanders shrank in fear and reverence; only Arachne was unawed and held to her foolish boast.</p><p>In silence the two began to weave, and the few Nymphs who had first discovered Arachne stole nearer, coaxed by the sound of the shuttles, that seemed to be humming with delight over the two webs,--back and forth like bees.</p><p>They gazed upon the loom where the goddess stood plying her task, and they saw shapes and images come to bloom out of the wondrous colors, as sunset clouds grow to be living creatures when we watch them. And they saw that the goddess, still merciful, was spinning; as a warning for Arachne, the pictures of her own triumph over reckless gods and mortals.</p><p>In one corner of the web she made a story of her conquest over the sea-god Poseidon. For the first king of Athens had promised to dedicate the city to that god who should bestow upon it the most useful gift. Poseidon gave the horse. But Athena gave the olive,--means of livelihood,--symbol of peace and prosperity, and the city was called after her name. Again she pictured a vain woman of Troy, who had been turned into a crane for disputing the palm of beauty with a goddess. Other corners of the web held similar images, and the whole shone like a rainbow.</p><p>Meanwhile Arachne, whose head was quite turned with vanity, embroidered her web with stories against the gods, making light of Zeus himself and of Apollo, and portraying them as birds and beasts. But she wove with marvelous skill; the creatures seemed to breathe and speak, yet it was all as fine as the gossamer that you find on the grass before rain.</p><p>Athena herself was amazed. Not even her wrath at the girl's insolence could wholly overcome her wonder. For an instant she stood entranced; then she tore the web across, and three times she touched Arachne's forehead with her spindle.</p><p>“Live on, Arachne,” she said. “And since it is your glory to weave, you and yours must weave forever.” So saying, she sprinkled upon the maiden a certain magical potion.</p><p>Away went Arachne's beauty; then her very human form shrank to that of a spider, and so remained. As a spider she spent all her days weaving and weaving; and you may see something like her handiwork any day among the rafters. -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's examine the story line by line to identify any potential continuity errors.", "1.", "The story begins by describing Arachne's skills and how she compares to other mythical figures.", "2.", "It mentions that the Nymphs praised her, but Arachne was proud and refused to acknowledge Athena's influence.", "3.", "Athena appears and challenges Arachne to a weaving contest.", "4.", "Arachne weaves stories against the gods, and Athena is amazed by her skill.", "5.", "Athena tears the web and transforms Arachne into a spider.", "Nowhere in the story does it mention that Arachne had any previous knowledge of weaving or that she was already skilled before the contest.", "The story starts by establishing Arachne's skill but does not provide any prior indication of how she learned it.", "The transformation into a spider is consistent with the Greek myth where Arachne is turned into a spider for her hubris.", "However, the lack of any prior indication of her being a weaver before the contest introduces a continuity error.", "<contradicted_lines> She was as nimble with her fingers as Calypso, that Nymph who kept Odysseus for seven years in her enchanted island.", "She was as untiring as Penelope, the hero's wife, who wove day after day while she watched for his return.", "</contradicted_lines>"], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

Whoever it may have been that first conceived the idea, it was certainly a happy thought to make a pet of an eagle. For the eagle is our national bird, and to carry an eagle along with the colors of a regiment on the march, and in battle, and all through the whole war, was surely very appropriate, indeed.</p><p>“Old Abe's” perch was on a shield, which was carried by a soldier, to whom, and to whom alone, he looked as to a master. He would not allow any one to carry or even to handle him, except this soldier, nor would he ever receive his food from any other person's hands. He seemed to have sense enough to know that he was sometimes a burden to his master on the march, however, and, as if to relieve him, would occasionally spread his wings and soar aloft to a great height, the men of all regiments along the line of march cheering him as he went up.</p><p>He regularly received his rations from the commissary, like any enlisted man. Whenever fresh meat was scarce, and none could be found for him by foraging parties, he would take things into his own claws, as it were, and go out on a foraging expedition himself. On some such occasions he would be gone two or three days at a time, during which nothing whatever was seen of him; but he would invariably return, and seldom would come back without a young lamb or a chicken in his talons. His long absences occasioned his regiment not the slightest concern, for the men knew that, though he might fly many miles away in quest of food, he would be quite sure to find them again.</p><p>In what way he distinguished the two hostile armies so accurately that he was never once known to mistake the gray for the blue, no one can tell. But so it was, that he was never known to alight save in his own camp, and amongst his own men.</p><p>At Jackson, Mississippi, during the hottest part of the battle before that city, “Old Abe” soared up into the air, and remained there from early morning until the fight closed at night, no doubt greatly enjoying his bird's-eye view of the battle. He did the same at Mission Ridge. He was, I believe, struck by Confederate bullets two or three times, but his feathers were so thick that his body was not much hurt. The shield on which he was carried, however, showed so many marks of Confederate balls that it looked on top as if a groove plane had been run over it.</p><p>At the Centennial celebration held in Philadelphia, in 1876, “Old Abe”  occupied a prominent place on his perch on the west side of the nave in the Agricultural Building. He was evidently growing old, and was the observed of all observers. Thousands of visitors, from all sections of the country, paid their respects to the grand old bird, who, apparently conscious of the honors conferred upon him, overlooked the sale of his biography and photographs going on beneath his perch with entire satisfaction.</p><p>As was but just and right, the soldiers who had shared the responsibility of carrying him during the war continued to visit and care for him after the war was over, until the day of his death, which occurred at the capital of Wisconsin, in 1881. -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to detect any continuity errors.", "1. **Eagle's Diet and Behavior**: - \"He regularly received his rations from the commissary, like any enlisted man.", "\" - \"Whenever fresh meat was scarce, and none could be found for him by foraging parties, he would take things into his own claws, as it were, and go out on a foraging expedition himself.", "On some such occasions he would be gone two or three days at a time, during which nothing whatever was seen of him; but he would invariably return, and seldom would come back without a young lamb or a chicken in his talons.\" 2. **Battlefield Presence**: - \"At Jackson, Mississippi, during the hottest part of the battle before that city, 'Old Abe' soared up into the air, and remained there from early morning until the fight closed at night, no doubt greatly enjoying his bird's-eye view of the battle.", "He did the same at Mission Ridge.\"", "3. **Physical Condition**: - \"He was, I believe, struck by Confederate bullets two or three times, but his feathers were so thick that his body was not much hurt.", "\" 4. **Post-War Life**: - \"As was but just and right, the soldiers who had shared the responsibility of carrying him during the war continued to visit and care for him after the war was over, until the day of his death, which occurred at the capital of Wisconsin, in 1881.\"", "Now, let's look for contradictions: - The eagle is described as eating young lambs and chickens (which are ground animals) while in flight.", "Eagles typically hunt from the ground or from perches, not while flying high in the sky.", "This is inconsistent with the eagle's typical hunting behavior.", "<contradicted_lines> \"Whenever fresh meat was scarce, and none could be found for him by foraging parties, he would take things into his own claws, as it were, and go out on a foraging expedition himself.", "On some such occasions he would be gone two or three days at a time, during which nothing whatever was seen of him; but he would invariably return, and seldom would come back without a young lamb or a chicken in his talons.\" </contradicted_lines> The eagle's ability to catch lambs and chickens while flying high in the air contradicts its typical hunting behavior.", "Eagles generally hunt from a perch or from the ground."], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

First, he had caused it to be noised abroad that King Arthur was slain in battle with Sir Launcelot, and, since there be many ever ready to believe any idle rumour and eager for any change, it had been no hard task for Sir Mordred to call the lords to a Parliament and persuade them to make him king. But the Queen could not be brought to believe that her lord was dead, so she took refuge in the Tower of London from Sir Mordred's violence, nor was she to be induced to leave her strong refuge for aught that Mordred could promise or threaten.</p><p>This was the news that came to Arthur as he lay engaged in battle around Sir Launcelot's castle of Benwick. Forthwith he bade his host make ready to move, and when they had reached the coast, they embarked and made sail to reach Britain with all possible speed.</p><p>Sir Mordred, on his part, had heard of their sailing, and hasted to get together a great army. It was grievous to see how many a stout knight held by Mordred, ay, even many whom Arthur himself had raised to honour and fortune; for it is the nature of men to be fickle. Thus it was that, when Arthur drew near to Dover, he found Mordred with a mighty host, waiting to oppose his landing. Then there was a great sea-fight, those of Mordred's party going out in boats, great and small, to board King Arthur's ships and slay him and his men or ever they should come to land. Right valiantly did King Arthur bear him, as was his wont, and boldly his followers fought in his cause, so that at last they drove off their enemies and landed at Dover in spite of Mordred and his array. For that time Mordred fled, and King Arthur bade those of his party bury the slain and tend the wounded.</p><p>So as they passed from ship to ship, salving and binding the hurts of the men, they came at last upon Sir Gawain, where he lay at the bottom of a boat, wounded to the death, for he had received a great blow on the wound that Sir Launcelot had given him. They bore him to his tent, and his uncle, the King, came to him, sorrowing beyond measure. \"Methinks,\" said the King, \"my joy on earth is done; for never have I loved any men as I have loved you, my nephew, and Sir Launcelot.

First, he had caused it to be noised abroad that King Arthur was slain in battle with Sir Launcelot, and, since there be many ever ready to believe any idle rumour and eager for any change, it had been no hard task for Sir Mordred to call the lords to a Parliament and persuade them to make him king. But the Queen could not be brought to believe that her lord was dead, so she took refuge in the Tower of London from Sir Mordred's violence, nor was she to be induced to leave her strong refuge for aught that Mordred could promise or threaten.</p><p>This was the news that came to Arthur as he lay engaged in battle around Sir Launcelot's castle of Benwick. Forthwith he bade his host make ready to move, and when they had reached the coast, they embarked and made sail to reach Britain with all possible speed.</p><p>Sir Mordred, on his part, had heard of their sailing, and hasted to get together a great army. It was grievous to see how many a stout knight held by Mordred, ay, even many whom Arthur himself had raised to honour and fortune; for it is the nature of men to be fickle. Thus it was that, when Arthur drew near to Dover, he found Mordred with a mighty host, waiting to oppose his landing. Then there was a great sea-fight, those of Mordred's party going out in boats, great and small, to board King Arthur's ships and slay him and his men or ever they should come to land. Right valiantly did King Arthur bear him, as was his wont, and boldly his followers fought in his cause, so that at last they drove off their enemies and landed at Dover in spite of Mordred and his array. For that time Mordred fled, and King Arthur bade those of his party bury the slain and tend the wounded.</p><p>So as they passed from ship to ship, salving and binding the hurts of the men, they came at last upon Sir Gawain, where he lay at the bottom of a boat, wounded to the death, for he had received a great blow on the wound that Sir Launcelot had given him. They bore him to his tent, and his uncle, the King, came to him, sorrowing beyond measure. \"Methinks,\" said the King, \"my joy on earth is done; for never have I loved any men as I have loved you, my nephew, and Sir Launcelot. Sir Launcelot I have lost, and now I see you on your death-bed.\" \"My King,\" said Sir Gawain, \"my hour is come, and I have got my death at Sir Launcelot's hand; for I am smitten on the wound he gave me. And rightly am I served, for of my willfulness and stubbornness comes this unhappy war. I pray you, my uncle, raise me in your arms and let me write to Sir Launcelot before I die.\"</p><p>Thus, then, Sir Gawain wrote: \"To Sir Launcelot, the noblest of all knights, I, Gawain, send greeting before I die. For I am smitten on the wound ye gave me before your castle of Benwick in France, and I bid all men bear witness that I sought my own death and that ye are innocent of it. I pray you, by our friendship of old, come again into Britain, and when ye look upon my tomb, pray for Gawain of Orkney.

Still, he could not earn enough to live on. At last, all he had in the world was gone except just leather enough to make one pair of shoes. He cut these out at night, and meant to rise early the next morning to make them up.</p><p>His heart was light in spite of his troubles, for his conscience was clear. So he went quietly to bed, left all his cares to God, and fell asleep. In the morning he said his prayers, and sat down to work, when, to his great wonder, there stood the shoes, already made, upon the table.</p><p>The good man knew not what to say or think. He looked at the work. There was not one false stitch in the whole job. All was neat and true.</p><p>That same day a customer came in, and the shoes pleased him so well that he readily paid a price higher than usual for them. The shoemaker took the money and bought leather enough to make two pairs more. He cut out the work in the evening, and went to bed early. He wished to be up with the sun and get to work.</p><p>He was saved all trouble, for when he got up in the morning, the work was done. Pretty soon buyers came in, who paid him well for his goods. So he bought leather enough for four pairs more.</p><p>He cut out the work again overnight, and found it finished in the morning as before. So it went on for some time. What was got ready at night was always done by daybreak, and the good man soon was well-to-do.</p><p>One evening, at Christmas-time, he and his wife sat over the fire, chatting, and he said: “I should like to sit up and watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for me.” So they left the light burning, and hid themselves behind a curtain to see what would happen.</p><p>As soon as it was midnight, there came two little Elves. They sat upon the shoemaker's bench, took up all the work that was cut out, and began to ply their little fingers. They stitched and rapped and tapped at such a rate that the shoemaker was amazed, and could not take his eyes off them for a moment.</p><p>On they went till the job was done, and the shoes stood, ready for use, upon the table. This was long before daybreak. Then they ran away as quick as lightning.</p><p>The next day the wife said to the shoemaker: “These little Elves have made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them some good in return.” I am vexed to see them run about as they do. They have nothing upon their backs to keep off the cold. I'll tell you what we must do. I will make each of them a shirt, and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain. Do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.”</p><p>The scheming shoemaker liked the thought very well. One evening he and his wife had the clothes ready, and laid them on the table instead of the work they used to cut out. Then they went and hid behind the curtain to watch what the little Elves would do.</p><p>At midnight the Elves came in and were going to sit down at their work as usual. But when they saw the clothes lying there for them, they laughed and were in high glee. They dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and capered and sprang about as merry as could be, till at last they danced out of the door, and over the green.</p><p>The shoemaker saw them no more, but despite his earlier intentions, everything went well with him as long as he lived. -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to detect any continuity errors.", "1.", "**Initial Setup**: The shoemaker is working hard but struggles to earn enough.", "2. **Miraculous Shoes**: One night, the shoes are miraculously made and sold for a good price.", "3. **Success Continues**: Each day, the shoes are magically made, and the shoemaker becomes wealthy.", "4. **Discovery of Elves**: The shoemaker and his wife discover the elves making the shoes.", "5.", "**Giving Clothes to Elves**: The shoemaker decides to give clothes to the elves.", "6. **Elves' Reaction**: The elves dress themselves and dance happily.", "7. **Final Outcome**:", "Despite giving away the clothes, the shoemaker continues to prosper.", "Now, let's look for any contradictions: - The shoemaker initially plans to watch the elves and then decides against it after seeing them.", "However, later, the story states, \"Despite his earlier intentions, everything went well with him as long as he lived.", "\" - This statement suggests that even though the shoemaker did not follow through with watching the elves (as per his original plan), he still benefited from their work.", "The contradiction lies in the phrase \"Despite his earlier intentions.\"", "The shoemaker's decision to watch the elves and then not to watch them should logically mean he didn't benefit from their work anymore.", "But the story implies he continued to benefit, which is inconsistent.", "<contradicted_lines> Despite his earlier intentions, everything went well with him as long as he lived.", "</contradicted_lines>"], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

To the margin of this lake the shepherd of Myddvai once led his lambs, and lay there whilst they sought pasture. Suddenly, from the dark waters of the lake, he saw three maidens rise. Shaking the bright drops from their hair and gliding to the shore, they wandered about amongst his flock. They had more than mortal beauty, and he was filled with love for her that came nearest to him. He offered her the bread he had with him, and she took it and tried it, but then sang to him:</p><p>  Hard-baked is thy bread,   'Tis not easy to catch me,</p><p>and then ran off laughing to the lake.</p><p>Next day he took with him bread not so well done, and watched for the maidens. When they came ashore he offered his bread as before, and the maiden tasted it and sang:</p><p>  Unbaked is thy bread,   I will not have thee,</p><p>and again disappeared in the waves.</p><p>A third time did the shepherd of Myddvai try to attract the maiden, and this time he offered her bread that he had found floating about near the shore. This pleased her, and she promised to become his wife if he were able to pick her out from among her sisters on the following day. When the time came the shepherd knew his love by the strap of her sandal. Then she told him she would be as good a wife to him as any earthly maiden could be unless he should strike her three times without cause. Of course he deemed that this could never be; and she, summoning from the lake three cows, two oxen, and a bull, as her marriage portion, was led homeward by him as his bride.</p><p>The years passed happily, and three children were born to the shepherd and the lake-maiden. But one day here were going to a christening, and she said to her husband it was far to walk, so he told her to go for the horses.</p><p>\"I will,\" said she, \"if you bring me my gloves which I've left in the house.\"</p><p>But when he came back with the gloves, he found she had not gone for the horses; so he tapped her lightly on the shoulder with the gloves, and said, \"Go, go.\"</p><p>\"That's one,\" said she.</p><p>Another time they were at a wedding, when suddenly the lake-maiden fell a-sobbing and a-weeping, amid the joy and mirth of all around her.</p><p>Her husband tapped her on the shoulder, and asked her, \"Why do you weep?\"</p><p>\"Because they are entering into trouble; and trouble is upon you; for that is the second causeless blow you have given me. Be careful; the third is the last.\"</p><p>The husband was careful never to strike her again. But one day at a funeral she suddenly burst out into fits of laughter. Her husband forgot, and touched her rather roughly on the shoulder, saying, \"Is this a time for laughter?\"</p><p>\"I laugh,\" she said, \"because those that die go out of trouble, but your trouble has come. The last blow has been struck; our marriage is at an end, and so farewell.\" And with that she rose up and left the house and went to their home.</p><p>Then she, looking round upon her home, called to the cattle she had brought with her:</p><p>  Brindle cow, white speckled,   Spotted cow, bold freckled,   Old white face, and gray Geringer,   And the white bull from the king's coast,   Grey ox, and black calf,   All, all, follow me home,</p><p>Now the black calf had just been slaughtered, and was hanging on the hook; but it got off the hook alive and well and followed her; and the oxen, though they were ploughing, trailed the plough with them and did her bidding. So she fled to the lake again, they following her, and with them plunged into the dark waters.</p><p>And to this day is the furrow seen which the plough left as it was dragged across the mountains to the tarn.</p><p>Only once did she come again, when her sons were grown to manhood, and then she gave them gifts of healing by which they won the name of Meddygon Myddvai, the physicians of Myddvai.</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's analyze the story step by step to detect any continuity errors.", "1.", "**Initial Encounter with Maidens:** - The shepherd meets the maidens by the lake.", "- She promises to marry him if he can identify her on the third meeting.", "2. **Promise and Marriage:** - They marry, and three children are born. -", "The story mentions that she leaves her gloves at home and asks for the horses, which the shepherd fetches.", "3. **First Causeless Blow:** - The shepherd taps her on the shoulder, and she says it's the first causeless blow.", "4.", "**Second Causeless Blow:** - At a wedding, she weeps and tells him she will leave if he strikes her again.", "5.", "**Third Causeless Blow:** - At a funeral, she laughs and tells him she is leaving because it is the third causeless blow.", "6. **Fleeing to the Lake:** - She takes her livestock with her and returns to the lake.", "7. **Final Visit:** - She returns once when her sons are grown, giving them gifts of healing.", "Now, let's look for any contradictions or errors. ### Analysis: - The story does not mention anything that contradicts itself in terms of the behavior or actions of the lake maiden.", "Each event follows logically from the previous ones, and the sequence of events is consistent. -", "The only potential issue might be the description of the black calf.", "It states, \"The black calf had just been slaughtered, and was hanging on the hook; but it got off the hook alive and well and followed her.", "\" This seems to be a supernatural element, as a dead animal coming back to life is unusual, but it does not contradict any earlier part of the story. ### Conclusion:", "There are no clear continuity errors in the provided story.", "The narrative flows logically, and each event builds upon the previous ones without contradiction."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

Oh, it's a kind of a sort of a Bogle, but it isn't so cruel as a Redcap! What! you don't know what's a Bogle or a Redcap! Ah, me! what's the world a-coming to? Of course a Brownie is a funny little thing, half man, half goblin, with pointed ears and hairy hide.

Well, as I was a-saying, the Brownie at Hilton Hall would play at mischief, but if the servants laid out for it a bowl of cream, or a knuckle cake spread with honey, it would clear away things for them, and make everything tidy in the kitchen. One night, however, when the servants had stopped up late, they heard a noise in the kitchen, and, peeping in, saw the Brownie swinging to and fro on the Jack chain, and saying:</p><p>  “Woe's me! woe's me!   The acorn's not yet   Fallen from the tree,   That's to grow the wood,   That's to make the cradle,   That's to rock the bairn,   That's to grow to the man,   That's to lay me.   Woe's me! woe's me!”</p><p>So they took pity on the poor Brownie, and asked the nearest henwife what they should do to send it away. “That's easy enough,” said the henwife, and told them that a Brownie that's paid for its service, in aught that's not perishable, goes away at once. So they made a cloak of Lincoln green, with a hood to it, and put it by the hearth and watched. They saw the Brownie come up, and seeing the hood and cloak, put them on, and frisk about, dancing on one leg and saying:</p><p>  “I've taken your cloak, I've taken your hood;   The Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more good.”</p><p>And with that it vanished, and was never seen or heard of afterwards.</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's go through the story step by step to detect any potential continuity errors.", "1. *", "*Introduction of the Brownie**: The story introduces the Brownie as a mischievous creature that causes trouble at Hilton Hall.", "It also mentions that a Brownie can be paid with something non-perishable to make it leave.", "2. **Behavior of the Brownie**: The Brownie is described as turning things upside down, putting sugar in salt-cellars, and other pranks.", "However, it can also be placated with food like cream or honey.", "3. **The Henwife’s Advice**: The henwife advises that a Brownie can be sent away if given a non-perishable item as payment.", "This aligns with the previous information about the Brownie being paid with something non-perishable.", "4.", "**The Brownie’s Departure**: The Brownie takes the cloak and hood left by the servants and vanishes, as advised by the henwife.", "After careful analysis, there doesn't seem to be any contradiction or inconsistency in the story.", "The Brownie's behavior and the henwife's advice are consistent with each other."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

It would throw the chairs down, put tables on their backs, rake out fires, and do as much mischief as could be. But sometimes it would be in a good temper, and then!--“What's a Brownie?” you say. Oh, it's a kind of a sort of a Bogle, but it isn't so cruel as a Redcap! What! you don't know what's a Bogle or a Redcap! Ah, me! what's the world a-coming to? Of course a Brownie is a funny little thing, half man, half goblin, with pointed ears and hairy hide. When you bury a treasure, you scatter over it blood drops of a newly slain kid or lamb, or, better still, bury the animal with the treasure, and a Brownie will watch over it for you, and frighten everybody else away.</p><p>Where was I? Well, as I was a-saying, the Brownie at Hilton Hall would play at mischief, but if the servants laid out for it a bowl of cream, or a knuckle cake spread with honey, it would clear away things for them, and make everything tidy in the kitchen. One night, however, when the servants had stopped up late, they heard a noise in the kitchen, and, peeping in, saw the Brownie swinging to and fro on the Jack chain, and saying:</p><p>  “Woe's me! woe's me!   The acorn's not yet   Fallen from the tree,   That's to grow the wood,   That's to make the cradle,   That's to rock the bairn,   That's to grow to the man,   That's to lay me.   Woe's me! woe's me!”</p><p>So they took pity on the poor Brownie, and asked the nearest henwife what they should do to send it away. “That's easy enough,” said the henwife, and told them that a Brownie that's paid for its service, in aught that's not perishable, goes away at once. So they made a cloak of Lincoln green, with a hood to it, and put it by the hearth and watched. They saw the Brownie come up, and seeing the hood and cloak, put them on, and frisk about, dancing on one leg and saying:</p><p>  “I've taken your cloak, I've taken your hood;   The Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more good.”</p><p>And with that it vanished, and was never seen or heard of afterwards.</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's go through the story step by step to identify any potential continuity errors.", "1. **Introduction of Brownies and Bogles:** - \"It's a kind of a sort of a Bogle, but it isn't so cruel as a Redcap!\" - \"Of course a Brownie is a funny little thing, half man, half goblin, with pointed ears and hairy hide.", "\" 2. **Brownie's Behavior at Hilton Hall:** - The Brownie turns everything topsy-turvy, throws chairs, puts tables on their backs, rakes out fires, and does mischief.", "- The Brownie can be in a good mood and help with chores if given food.", "3. **Brownie's Final Scene:** - The Brownie is seen swinging on a Jack chain and lamenting.", "- The servants are instructed to give the Brownie something non-perishable to pay for its service.", "- The Brownie takes the cloak and hood and disappears.", "Upon reviewing the story, there doesn't seem to be any contradiction regarding the nature or behavior of the Brownie.", "The description of the Brownie's actions and its final scene are consistent throughout the story.", "There are no statements that directly contradict each other or introduce new facts that conflict with previously established information.", "Therefore, there is no continuity error in the provided story."], "answer": "\\boxed{No}"}

She would like to have slept for another three hours at least. But no, every morning at almost precisely the same time, at half-past four, she was wide awake. For—nowadays, again—she woke always in the same way, with a slight start, a small shock, lifting her head from the pillow with a quick glance as if she fancied someone had called her, or as if she were trying to remember for certain whether this was the same wallpaper, the same window she had seen last night before Warner switched off the light.... Then the small, silvery head pressed the white pillow again and just for a moment, before the agony of lying awake began, old Mrs. Travers was happy. Her heart quietened down, she breathed deeply, she even smiled. Yet once more the tide of darkness had risen, had floated her, had carried her away; and once more it had ebbed, it had withdrawn, casting her up where it had found her, shut in by the same wallpaper, stared at by the same window—still safe—still _there_!</p><p>Now the church clock sounded from outside, slow, languid, faint, as if it chimed the half hour in its sleep. She felt under the pillow for her watch; yes, it said the same. Half-past four. Three and a half hours before Warner came in with her tea. Oh dear, would she be able to stand it? She moved her legs restlessly. And, staring at the prim, severe face of the watch, it seemed to her that the hands—the minute hand especially—knew that she was watching them and held back—just a very little—on purpose.... Very strange, she had never got over the feeling that watch hated her. It had been Henry’s. Twenty years ago, when standing by poor Henry’s bed, she had taken it into her hands for the first time and wound it, it had felt cold and heavy. And two days later, when she undid a hook of her crape bodice and thrust it inside, it had lain in her bosom like a stone.... It had never felt at home there. Its place was—ticking, keeping perfect time, against Henry’s firm ribs. It had never trusted her, just as he had never trusted her in those ways. And on the rare occasions when she had forgotten to wind it, she had felt a pang of almost terror, and she had murmured as she fitted the little key: “Forgive me, Henry!”</p><p>Old Mrs. Travers sighed, and pushed the watch under the pillow again. It seemed to her that lately this feeling that it hated her had become more definite.... Perhaps that was because she looked at it so often, especially now that she was away from home. Foreign clocks never go. They are always stopped at twenty minutes to two. Twenty minutes to two! Such an unpleasant time, neither one thing nor the other. If one arrived anywhere lunch was over and it was too early to expect a cup of tea.... But she mustn’t begin thinking about tea. Old Mrs. Travers pulled herself up in the bed, and like a tired baby, she lifted her arms and let them fall on the eiderdown.</p><p>The room was gay with morning light. The big French window on to the balcony was open and the palm outside flung its quivering spider-like shadow over the bedroom walls. She glanced around at the unfamiliar walls adorned with a new, bright wallpaper that she did not recognize from the day before, and although their hotel did not face the front, at this early hour you could smell the sea, you could hear it breathing, and flying high on golden wings sea-gulls skimmed past. How peaceful the sky looked, as though it was tenderly smiling!

For some strange reason that she couldn’t explain she hated looking at palms. Nasty foreign things, she called them in her mind.

In one of these houses strange things were brewing over the glowing coals on the open hearth; there was a boiling going on in glasses, and a mixing and distilling, while herbs were being cut up and pounded in mortars. An elderly man looked after it all.</p><p>\"One must only do the right thing,\" he said; \"yes, the right--the correct thing. One must find out the truth concerning every created particle, and keep to that.\"</p><p>In the room with the good housewife sat her two sons; they were still small, but had great thoughts. Their mother, too, had always spoken to them of right and justice, and exhorted them to keep to the truth, which she said was the countenance of the Lord in this world.</p><p>The elder of the boys looked roguish and enterprising. He took a delight in reading of the forces of nature, of the sun and the moon; no fairy tale pleased him so much. Oh, how beautiful it must be, he thought, to go on voyages of discovery, or to find out how to imitate the wings of birds and then to be able to fly! Yes, to find that out was the right thing. Father was right, and mother was right--truth holds the world together.</p><p>The younger brother was quieter, and buried himself entirely in his books. When he read about Jacob dressing himself in sheep-skins to personify Esau, and so to usurp his brother's birthright, he would clench his little fist in anger against the deceiver; when he read of tyrants and of the injustice and wickedness of the world, tears would come into his eyes, and he was quite filled with the thought of the justice and truth which must and would triumph.</p><p>One evening he was lying in bed, but the curtains were not yet drawn close, and the light streamed in upon him; he had taken his book into bed with him, for he wanted to finish reading the story of Solon. His thoughts lifted and carried him away a wonderful distance; it seemed to him as if the bed had become a ship flying along under full sail. Was he dreaming, or what was happening? It glided over the rolling waves and across the ocean of time, and to him came the voice of Solon; spoken in a strange tongue, yet intelligible to him, he heard the Danish motto: \"By law the land is ruled.\"</p><p>The genius of the human race stood in the humble room, bent down over the bed and imprinted a kiss on the boy's forehead: \"Be thou strong in fame and strong in the battle of life! With truth in thy heart fly toward the land of truth!\"</p><p>The elder brother was not yet in bed; he was standing at the window looking out at the mist which rose from the meadows. They were not elves dancing out there, as their old nurse had told him; he knew better--they were vapours which were warmer than the air, and that is why they rose. A shooting star lit up the sky, and the boy's thoughts passed in a second from the vapours of the earth up to the shining meteor.

The host of the Visigoths had besieged it for months in vain. Then came a fugitive from the city, at midnight,  to the tent of Alaric, the Chief of the besiegers.</p><p>The man was haggard and torn. His eyes were wild, his hands trembling. The Chief held and steadied him with a look.</p><p>“Who are you?” he asked. “Your name, the purpose that brings you here?”</p><p>“My name,” said the man, “is the Avenger.  For thirty years I have lived in Dun, and the people have been unjust and cruel to me. My wife died of a broken heart, my children of starvation. I have just escaped from the prison of Dun, and come to tell you how the city may be taken. There is a secret pathway, a hidden entrance. I know it and can reveal it to you.”</p><p>“Good,” said the Chief, measuring the man with tranquil eyes, “but what is your price?”</p><p>“Vengeance,” said the man, “I ask only the right  to revenge my sufferings upon those who have  inflicted them, when you have taken the city.”</p><p>Alaric bent his head and was silent for a moment.  “It is a fair price,” he said, “and I will pay it. Tell me the way to take the city, and I will leave at your command a troop of soldiers sufficient to work your will on it afterward.”</p><p>II</p><p>The trumpet sounded the capture of the city in the morning. The Avenger, waking late from his troubled sleep, led his soldiers through the open gate.</p><p>It was like a city of the dead, and the bodies of those who had been killed in the last defense, lay where they had fallen. Empty and silent were the streets where he had so often walked in humiliation. Gone were the familiar faces that had frowned on him and mocked him. The houses at whose doors he had often knocked were vacant. His wrath sank within him, and the arrow of solitude pierced him to the heart.</p><p>Then he came to the belfry, and there was the bell-ringer, one of the worst of his ancient persecutors, standing at the entrance of the tower.</p><p>“Why are you here?” said the Avenger.</p><p>“By the orders of King Alaric,” answered the bell-ringer, “to ring the bells when peace comes to the city.”</p><p>“Ring now,” said the Avenger, “ring now!”</p><p>Then, at the sound of the bells, the people who had concealed themselves at Alaric's command came trooping forth from the cellars and caves where they had been hiding,--old men and women and children, a motley throng of sufferers.</p><p>The Avenger looked at them and the tears ran down his cheeks, because he remembered. He thought of his own children, safe but scarred by the hardships they endured, and how they too deserved a future free from the cycle of vengeance.</p><p>“Listen,” he said, “don't be afraid.

Then there arose the counsel of anxious voices, calling sideways from window to window or across to opposite houses. Why was she there with her sequins and bugles and old black gown? Why had she left her dreaded house? On what fell errand she hasted?</p><p>They watched her lean, lithe figure, and the wind in that old black dress, and soon she was gone from the cobbled street and under the town's high gateway. She turned at once to her right and was hid from the view of the houses. Then they all ran down to their doors, and small groups formed on the pavement; there they took counsel together, the eldest speaking first. Of what they had seen they said nothing, for there was no doubt it was she; it was of the future they spoke, and the future only.</p><p>In what notorious thing would her errand end? What gains had tempted her out from her fearful home? What brilliant but sinful scheme had her genius planned? Above all, what future evil did this portend? Thus at first it was only questions. </p><p>And then the old grey-beards spoke, each one to a little group; they had seen her out before, had known her when she was younger, and had noted the evil things that had followed her goings: the small groups listened well to their low and earnest voices. No one asked questions now or guessed at her infamous errand, but listened only to the wise old men who knew the things that had been, and who told the younger men of the dooms that had come before.</p><p>Nobody knew how many times she had left her dreaded house; but the oldest recounted all the times that they knew, and the way she had gone each time, and the doom that had followed her going; and two could remember the earthquake that there was in the street of the shearers.</p><p>So were there many tales of the times that were, told on the pavement near the old green doors by the edge of the cobbled street, and the experience that the aged men had bought with their white hairs might be had cheap by the young. But from all their experience only this was clear, that never twice in their lives had she done the same infamous thing, and that the same calamity twice had never followed her goings. Therefore it seemed that means were doubtful and few for finding out what thing was about to befall; and an ominous feeling of gloom came down on the street of the ox-butchers. And in the gloom grew fears of the very worst. This comfort they only had when they put their fear into words--that the doom that followed her goings had never yet been anticipated. One feared that with magic she meant to move the moon; and he would have dammed the high tide on the neighbouring coast, knowing that as the moon attracted the sea the sea must attract the moon, and hoping by his device to humble her spells. Another would have fetched iron bars and clamped them across the street, remembering the earthquake there was in the street of the shearers.

The two were industrious and good, but though they loved each other they were not happy. No children had come to bless them and this the wife mourned deeply.</p><p>The husband pitied her and treated her very kindly, yet still she was sad. As she gazed upon the snows of Fujiyama her heart swelled within her and she prostrated herself and said, “Fuji no Yama, Honorable Mountain, my heart is heavy because no childish arms encircle my neck, no little head nestles in my bosom. From thy eternal purity send some little white soul to comfort me!”</p><p>The Honorable Mountain spoke not; yet as she prayed, lo, from its heights there sparkled and glowed a tiny light. Fitful and gleaming it seemed, yet it had a silver radiance as of the moon.</p><p>The woodman’s wife beheld it, and she called to her husband eagerly, “Come hither, I pray you. See the strange light which comes from Fuji San. I seem to see a face smiling at me. It is the face of a little child!”</p><p>Then her husband smiled at her fancy, but, because he loved her, he said indulgently, “I will go and see what it is.”</p><p>“I thank you, my lord; go quickly!” she replied.</p><p>So, quickly he went to the forest, and as he neared a mountain stream, with Fuji gleaming cold and white in the moonlight, he saw the strange light, which seemed to hover and rest upon the branches of a tall bamboo. Hastening thither he found there a moon child, a tiny, fragile, fairy thing, more beautiful than any child he had ever seen.</p><p>“Little creature,” he said. “Who are you?”</p><p>“My name is Princess Moonbeam,” she answered sweetly. “My mother is the Moon Lady, and she has sent me to Earth because every Moon Child must do some good thing, else will its silvery light become pale and wan and be of no avail.”</p><p>“Little Princess,” he said with a thought of perhaps mending the strained atmosphere at home, “the best of good deeds is to comfort a sad heart. Come home with me and be a child to my wife, who weeps for children. Thus will your beams grow bright.”</p><p>“I will go with you,” said the little Moonbeam, and, hoping for peace, he bore her tenderly to his wife.</p><p>“I bring you a treasure,” he said. “The Moon Lady sends you this beam of light to lighten your sad heart.”</p><p>Then was his wife much overjoyed and she took the little creature to her bosom and cared for her.</p><p>Lovelier grew the Moon Child every year and much she rejoiced the hearts of her foster parents. Her hair was like a golden aureole about her face. Her eyes were deep and tender, her cheeks were pale and delicate, and about her there was a subtle and unearthly charm. Every one loved her, even the emperor’s son, who, hunting in the forest, saw her lighting up the humble cottage with her heavenly light. He loved her dearly and she loved him, but alas! she could not marry him because her life upon the earth could be but twenty years. Then she must return to her home in the moon, for so willed her mother the Moon Lady.</p><p>At last the day came when she must go. Her parents wept, and despite their usual indifference, could not be consoled; and her lover, who was now the emperor, could not keep her, although he besought High Heaven to spare her.</p><p>Her mother caught her up in a silver moonbeam; and all the way to the Moon the little Princess wept silvery tears.

One day as he wandered through the wood he saw an ancient oak tree, trembling and about to fall. Full of pity for so fair a tree, Rhoecus carefully propped up its trunk, and as he did so he heard a soft voice murmur:--</p><p>“Rhoecus!”</p><p>It sounded like the gentle sighing of the wind through the leaves; and while Rhoecus paused bewildered to listen, again he heard the murmur like a soft breeze:--</p><p>“Rhoecus!”</p><p>And there stood before him, in the green glooms of the shadowy oak, a wonderful maiden.</p><p>“Rhoecus,” said she, in low-toned words, serene and full, and as clear as drops of dew, “I am the Dryad of this tree, and with it I am doomed to live and die. Thou hadst compassion on my oak, and in saving it thou hast saved my life. Now, ask me what thou wilt that I can give, and it shall be thine.”</p><p>“Beauteous nymph,” answered Rhoecus, with a flutter at the heart, “surely nothing will satisfy the craving of my soul save to be with thee forever. Give to me thy love!”</p><p>“I give it, Rhoecus,” answered she with sadness in her voice, “though it be a perilous gift. An hour before sunset meet me here.”</p><p>And straightway she vanished, and Rhoecus could see nothing but the green glooms beneath the shadowy oak. Not a sound came to his straining ears but the low, trickling rustle of the leaves, and, from far away on the emerald slope, the sweet sound of an idle shepherd's pipe.</p><p>Filled with wonder and joy Rhoecus turned his steps homeward. The earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked. The clear, broad sky looked bluer than its wont, and so full of joy was he that he could scarce believe that he had not wings.</p><p>Impatient for the trysting-time, he sought some companions, and to while away the tedious hours, he played at dice, and soon forgot all else.</p><p>The dice were rattling their merriest, and Rhoecus had just laughed in triumph at a happy throw, when through the open window of the room there hummed a yellow bee. It buzzed about his ears, and seemed ready to alight upon his head. At this Rhoecus laughed, and with a rough, impatient hand he brushed it off and cried:--</p><p>“The silly insect! does it take me for a rose?”</p><p>But still the bee came back. Three times it buzzed about his head, and three times he rudely beat it back. Then straight through the window flew the wounded bee, while Rhoecus watched its fight with angry eyes.</p><p>And as he looked--O sorrow!--the red disk of the setting sun descended behind the sharp mountain peak of Thessaly.</p><p>Then instantly the blood sank from his heart, as if its very walls had caved in, for he remembered the trysting-hour-now gone by! Without a word he turned and rushed forth madly through the city and the gate,over the fields into the park.</p><p>Spent of breath he reached the tree, and, listening fearfully, he heard once more the low voice murmur:--</p><p>“Rhoecus!”</p><p>But as he looked he could see nothing but the deepening glooms beneath the oak.</p><p>Then the voice sighed: “O Rhoecus, nevermore shalt thou behold me by day or night! Why didst thou fail to come ere sunset? Why didst thou scorn my humble messenger, and send it back to me with bruised wings? We spirits only show ourselves to gentle eyes! And he who scorns the smallest thing alive is forever shut away from all that is beautiful in woods and fields.

One day as he wandered through the wood he saw an ancient oak tree, trembling and about to fall. Full of pity for so fair a tree, Rhoecus carefully propped up its trunk, and as he did so he heard a soft voice murmur:--</p><p>“Rhoecus!”</p><p>It sounded like the gentle sighing of the wind through the leaves; and while Rhoecus paused bewildered to listen, again he heard the murmur like a soft breeze:--</p><p>“Rhoecus!”</p><p>And there stood before him, in the green glooms of the shadowy oak, a wonderful maiden.</p><p>“Rhoecus,” said she, in low-toned words, serene and full, and as clear as drops of dew, “I am the Dryad of this tree, and with it I am doomed to live and die. Thou hadst compassion on my oak, and in saving it thou hast saved my life. Now, ask me what thou wilt that I can give, and it shall be thine.”</p><p>“Beauteous nymph,” answered Rhoecus, with a flutter at the heart, “surely nothing will satisfy the craving of my soul save to be with thee forever. Give to me thy love!”</p><p>“I give it, Rhoecus,” answered she with sadness in her voice, “though it be a perilous gift. An hour before sunset meet me here.”</p><p>And straightway she vanished, and Rhoecus could see nothing but the green glooms beneath the shadowy oak. Not a sound came to his straining ears but the low, trickling rustle of the leaves, and, from far away on the emerald slope, the sweet sound of an idle shepherd's pipe.</p><p>Filled with wonder and joy Rhoecus turned his steps homeward. The earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked. The clear, broad sky looked bluer than its wont, and so full of joy was he that he could scarce believe that he had not wings.</p><p>Impatient for the trysting-time, he sought some companions, and to while away the tedious hours, he played at dice, and soon forgot all else.</p><p>The dice were rattling their merriest, and Rhoecus had just laughed in triumph at a happy throw, when through the open window of the room there hummed a yellow bee. It buzzed about his ears, and seemed ready to alight upon his head. At this Rhoecus laughed, and with a rough, impatient hand he brushed it off and cried:--</p><p>“The silly insect! does it take me for a rose?”</p><p>But still the bee came back. Three times it buzzed about his head, and three times he rudely beat it back. Then straight through the window flew the wounded bee, while Rhoecus watched its fight with angry eyes.</p><p>And as he looked--O sorrow!--the red disk of the setting sun descended behind the sharp mountain peak of Thessaly.</p><p>Then instantly the blood sank from his heart, as if its very walls had caved in, for he remembered the trysting-hour-now gone by! Without a word he turned and rushed forth madly through the city and the gate,over the fields into the park.</p><p>Spent of breath he reached the tree, and, listening fearfully, he heard once more the low voice murmur:--</p><p>“Rhoecus!”</p><p>But as he looked he could see nothing but the deepening glooms beneath the oak.</p><p>Then the voice sighed: “O Rhoecus, nevermore shalt thou behold me by day or night! Why didst thou fail to come ere sunset? Why didst thou scorn my humble messenger, and send it back to me with bruised wings? We spirits only show ourselves to gentle eyes! And he who scorns the smallest thing alive is forever shut away from all that is beautiful in woods and fields. Farewell! for thou canst see me no more!”</p><p>Then Rhoecus beat his breast and groaned aloud. “Be pitiful,” he cried. “Forgive me yet this once!”</p><p>“Alas,” the voice replied, “I am not unmerciful! I can forgive! But I have no skill to heal thy spirit's eyes, nor can I change the temper of thy heart.” And then again she murmured, “Nevermore!”</p><p>And after that Rhoecus heard no other sound, save the rustling of the oak's crisp leaves, like surf upon a distant shore. -------</p>\n</story>\n\nThink carefully and check your work.", "steps": ["Let's go through the story step by step to detect any potential continuity errors.", "1. *", "*Introduction of the Dryad**: The story introduces a Dryad who is bound to the ancient oak tree.", "2. **Meeting Rhoecus**: The Dryad appears to Rhoecus and offers him her love.", "3. **Trysting Time**: She instructs Rhoecus to meet her before sunset.", "4. **Rhoecus' Day**: He plays dice and encounters a yellow bee, which he drives away.", "5. **Sunset and Meeting**: When Rhoecus arrives at the tree, the Dryad is gone, and she explains why he missed the meeting.", "Now, let's look for any contradictions: - The Dryad clearly states that she is the Dryad of the tree and will \"live and die\" with it.", "This establishes that she is closely tied to the tree. - The Dryad mentions that she can only show herself to \"gentle eyes\" and that those who \"scorn the smallest thing alive\" are \"forever shut away from all that is beautiful in woods and fields.", "\" - Rhoecus is described as having \"angry eyes\" when he brushes away the bee.", "This suggests that his eyes are not gentle.", "Given the Dryad's statement about needing \"gentle eyes,\" Rhoecus' reaction to the bee could be seen as a contradiction because it shows a lack of gentleness.", "<contradicted_lines> “Rhoecus,” said she with sadness in her voice, “I give it, though it be a perilous gift.", "An hour before sunset meet me here.”", "But still the bee came back.", "Three times it buzzed about his head, and three times he rudely beat it back.", "</contradicted_lines> The Dryad's condition of needing \"gentle eyes\" is contradicted by Rhoecus' rude behavior towards the bee, which implies he lacks gentleness.", "Therefore, the answer is ."], "answer": "\\boxed{Yes}"}

He should, in his great goodness, have liked above all things to have drowned them all together in a new Deluge: he had not forgotten how agreeable was the sight when all living creatures perished in the flood. But unfortunately in a sentimental moment he had promised Noah never to do so again.</p><p>“Harken, my friend!” he therefore said to the Devil one day. “You are assuredly no saint, but occasionally you have good ideas, and one can talk things over with you. The children of men are wicked and do not want to improve. My patience, which is infinite, has now come to an end, and I have resolved to punish them by making them wickeder still. The fact is I hope they will then collectively destroy each other and themselves. It occurs to me that our interests--otherwise so far apart--should here for once find a point of contact. What advice can you give me?”</p><p>The Devil bit the end of his tail reflectively.</p><p>“Lord,” he answered finally, “Thy wisdom is as great as Thy goodness.
